"Pure garbage: This is a nice Briggs and Stratton engine wrapped in a bunch of cheap plastic. I was excited to get a new mower, read a bunch of great reviews. It got here and I was pretty happy with the way it looked. I went to use it, tried to lower the wheels and realized it was pretty cheaply made. The front wheel assembly barely held on in each notch to raise or lower the cut. Fired it up, easily. Sounded good. Went to mow my standard, normal, level, non overgrown, run-o-the-mill lawn.

"Total Junk: Don't buy this mower.  It is total garbage.  Everything on it is cheaply made.  The wheel adjustments don't lock in place and fall while mowing, scalping chunks out of the lawn.  Random pieces fall off while mowing, like the handle comfort bar, the clip that holds the cord in place, etc.  The self-propel locks up the wheels and you can't pull the mower back toward you. The mulching bag does not fit properly and blows grass and dirt directly into your face.  The engine design sucks grass clipping...[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Reasonably priced quality unit for small lawns: I rented a house in Denton so my son can attend UNT. It has a front and back yard, and we are responsible for mowing those. This was a reasonable priced unit from a good vendor. It went together easily, and included a bottle of good 30W oil suitable for the mower. I managed to put gas in it and it cranked right up on first pull. It is self propelled (via back wheels) so it's not that hard to mow with it (I'm 72).[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1.

"Junk: This mower is honestly and truly terrible. My biggest complaint is how weak it is. I have very small yard in a neighborhood so, I felt like this mower would be perfect. Boy how I was wrong, it dies just about every 10 feet. I mow my yard at least once a week, it’s not like I’m mowing a jungle. It just cannot go through thick grass no matter how tall it is.

"Very dissapointing: Bag design is terrible. Because the bag bottom does not run the length of the frame, a large amount of the bag contents fall out as you remove the small bag.

Worst part is that after less than 60 days and 4 uses at the most, the self-propel mechanism stopped working. Lowe's is not help since, as they put it, I didn't pay for the extended warranty. 

Will update after I get a response from the local Toro dealer.

Worst lawnmower ever: I had my last lawn mower for over 15 years and never once had a problem with it. I sold it because my boyfriend at the time had a lawnmower and we didn’t need two. After we broke up I needed another lawn mower. I bought this piece of crap. Mowed my small yard one time last year and this season it wouldn’t start. I cleaned carbeurator and was able to get it working again. I have only used it three times since and it just quit working again. Total piece of junk!! Do not buy[Rating - 1/5],1,"1.

"Easy Starting: I enjoy mowing the lawn...but I have always hated the hassle of starting the engine.

The Toro almost always starts on the first pull.  Rarely, a second pull is required.

It is very easy to adjust the height of the wheels by a quick push on the height lever.



The auto drive pushes the mower at a faster than average speed but relaxing your grip on the control bar slows it down.

I decided a one star deduction was in order because of the ""instructions"" included with the product.  Hand drawings and arrows just aren't my idea of helpful.
