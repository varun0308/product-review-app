"Grill = great but issues with Lowe’s assembly x2: Love my Blackstone grill (eating 5/5) and the Lowe’s delivery service was punctual and provided great service (rating 5/5). 
The challenges with both deliveries were related to assembly. First grill was just sloppy assembly with bolts not fully tightened (they were actually falling out upon inspection) which caused damage to the frame assembly. Second delivery was better but grill was missing the stoppers which protect/eliminate direct, metal-on-metal contact between lid and body which caused heat resistant paint to chip. Rating for assembly and follow up service = 2/5
Lowe’s promised a credit which has yet to be processed or confirmed. 
Moral of the story…inspect your delivery closely and understand that the delivery team has nothing to do with assembly.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Manufacturing issues - no qc: We have been looking at the Blackstone griddles for several months, mainly at the used ones for sale in our area. None if these were in decent shape so yesterday we opted to buy a new on 36"" 4-burner model.
I sat down and read through the assembly instructions, opened the box and did a quick inventory.  I didn't have any real difficulty in putting the thing together.
My problem was in the factory construction.  Within a few minutes, I found that one of the cross members that connects the front leg to the back leg had the end piece on upside down.  
The hole that the screw goes through was not there.  I looked at the end of the piece and saw that this piece was put on backwards.
I'm a pretty handy fella so I just drilled a hole in the proper place.  Problem solved.
The next issue came into focus when I was putting the wing shelves on.  
The instructions said to use the shoulder bolt in the top hole on both sides of the shelf for both shelves.
The problem here was that the little nut that is spot welded where the shoulder bolt should go was not there.  The little nuts were both welded on the same side of the shelf in the top and bottom holes.  
I have some nuts and bolts so I just grabbed two of each and put them through the hole that should have been home to a little nut.
This will probably affect the ability for the shelf to be folded down but it dont care too much.
The Chinese labor market keeps this product cheap but they really don't care.  I doubt if Blackstone can penalize them for too many mistakes.
At any rate, I finished assembly, seasoned the griddle and called it good enough.

I've used it once and think it'll be fine.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Horrible Assembly: I had this pre-assembled prior to delivery. I would suggest assembling it yourself.  After it was delivered, I inspected it. The center shelf was put on upside down and backward. I assume it was because they didn't want the reach under to tighten the screws. The propane tank stabilizer was barely on, and the nut was stripped.

"Avoid Lowe’s Assembly!!: This review is mainly about how terrible Lowe’s is, I love my Blackstone. I purchased my Blackstone online and chose free assembly and delivery through Lowe’s. When it was delivered everything seemed fine for a couple months because it never moved. However when I tried to roll it to a different part of my deck the whole grill nearly collapsed because only 1 bolt was installed in each leg connecting to the grill. There are supposed to be 4 on each leg! After speaking with 5 different customer service people, Lowe’s sent a tech out to look at it. The tech did not bring any bolts or other hardware to fix it. I was told to contact customer service again who told me they could do nothing and to contact Blackstone directly. Do yourself a favor and avoid Lowe’s at all costs.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

"Pretty straightforward, but a few build changes...: This was delivered on a Friday afternoon, and I thought I'd be able to build it that evening, but ran out of time, so finished on a Saturday afternoon.

Overall, the build was pretty straightforward. It did take about 30 minutes to unpack everything, and it seems a lot of the complaints about quality may have been addressed. Tons of padding, reinforcing, etc, and none of the dents others had mentioned, though there were a few nicks to the griddle bed in one corner, and the sticker on the left shelf did pull up a few spots of the finish, but not enough to worry about.

What I mostly want to address is the mods to the official build instructions that ended up making my life easier. First, let's address the most disconcerting... An un-numbered sheet inserted loose into the manual to install 4 rubber bumpers... After a little study, it should be followed any time after the burner body (step 9) is installed. Fairly simple and easy, just push the 4 bumpers in the bag with the manual into the 2 front holes and the 2 in the grease catcher nook.

The next thing that gave me issues was the propane tank support in step 7. The instructions reference a second M6 nut that I spent a good deal of time looking for, but it doesn't exist. The shelf that it screws into already has a threaded hole for the M6x12 screw used to attach it. I'm guessing this may be a late manufacturing revision.

Also, it wasn't obvious in step 6 that the garbage bag holder would be a problem later on. Hold off on installing it until after the burner body is attached, as the screws for the bag holder interfered with every screwdriver I could find, and I eventually removed it to screw in the body.

Now, the most significant change that I made... Step 9 has you mounting the burner body, screwing in 2 screws from inside the burner box, and 12 from below through the legs. I ran into a problem where in about 45 minutes, I still couldn't get the holes in the legs aligned enough for the screws to thread. Then ran out of light and patience for the day...

A little thought that evening, and I decided I needed alignment pins to square up the legs and align the holes. Fortunately, there are 8 of the ""screw in from underneath"" holes accessible from the burner box. If you screw in those 8 screws from inside the burner box, they stick out enough to engage with the mounting holes in the legs, aligning them enough to install the screws for the other (blind) holes. Once those are installed, remove 1 ""backwards"" screw at a time, and put it in from the bottom. It was fairly simple to get them all in after that epiphany. Again, either avoid or remove the garbage bag holder to make the right side significantly easier to attach.

For the side shelves, just remove the 2 bottom screws on each completely, as it makes their installation much easier.

SO! All that being said, hopefully making the construction easier for others...

Seasoning was fairly simple, just follow the instructions. It took maybe a couple hours all told to do it 5 times (the recommendation is 3-5). I did use the official seasoning mix for the first, but decided to switch to much more plentiful (and cheaper) vegetable oil for the last 4 rounds.

Either there was a revision, or some of the propane tank hanging issues others have mentioned may have been exaggerated, as there's some, but not significant tilt in the mounting of the tank.

The side shelves do get hot during use. My non-contact thermometer measured about 150F during the seasoning process. Not unexpected, but anything sensitive to heat, you may want to place somewhere else.

I honestly never expected to use either the paper towel or garbage bag holder, but ended up using both of them right away, especially considering how many paper towels I used during seasoning.

As for cooking performance, keep in mind I've cooked a grand total of 1 meal on this thing. That being said, they were the best burgers I've had at home in a long time. A deliciously lovely crust, and since I'm just learning the ways of the griddle, cooked slightly more than my wife and I prefer. But! They were still juicy, which is a big win. Toasting the buns went well, too, again not knowing how everything would perform. I kept temps rather low, maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of a turn from the lowest settings (after about a 10 minute heat-up on high, then prepping things).

Cleanup was relatively easy (with the 3 piece spatula & scraper accessories). Just waited until things had cooled down, then scrape, wipe, scrape with water from a squeeze bottle, wipe, then a light coating of oil. All directly from the manual. The rear grease trap is a treat, definitely get the liners to make your life easier (1 comes with, and the packs aren't bank-breaking). The only other absolutely need-to-have accessory, IMO, is the cover, in order to protect this investment for years to come. I did order other accessories (in for a penny, in for a pound, and all that), but the spatula/scraper set and cover are about the only things I'd say are ""essential"" to add on.

We're pretty excited about what we'll be able to do in the future, since we've been relegated to mostly stove or one of those electric air fryer/grill monstrosities (that I despise) for a while now.

All in all, as I've been biding my time for a few years now on an appropriate grill replacement, this Blackstone literally called to me, and I can see having a great relationship with it for quite a bit of my cooking needs in the future.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"High Quality - Opt for the Pre-built: Purchased the 36in Culinary, upgrading from a 22inch adventure model. The culinary series is Lowes specific and it includes a few upgrades that customers complained on other models. If you don't think you'll be moving it very much, then the wind guards and hood that model are clutch.  It was easy to season, and cooks very well, even with the reduced BTU output. I recommend opting for the pre-built models, if you can transport it. I purchased one in the box, because the floor models had scratches on it, but ended up having to put mine together well into the night, and the instructions could be a little more clear.  After I was done assembling it, it ended up with scratches anyway.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Great Unit!: Overall, amazing!  Couple minor issues and only reason it’s not a (5) star: 1) when cleaning, the top is up, and you shove all the mess through the cleaning hole at the back, and when doing so, you end up dropping a bit of grease and mess into the back lip of the top (bad design), 2) super minor but the paper towel holder overlaps the LP tank hook, so you can’t really slide in, plus the hook is too far for a standard roll to actually turn, you have to cram it on, 3) although not super difficult to put together, I found that 3 of the 4 holes to screw the wheels in where a bit mangled, which would be fine if you could fit a wrench in there to tighten on.  I had to use the smallest wrench I could find, and it was still too thick and scrapped up the bottom of the leg, so I had to use primer paint to touch up, not because anyone would see it, but because I didn’t want it to rust over time, and 4) my unit had a large advertising sticker plastered on the griddle top, which took a lot of extra work to get off, and I also noticed a bit of surface rust under the sticker too.  Again, nothing major and easy enough to cleanup before seasoning, but was a bit of time I didn’t expect.  Overall the unit is great once up and running![Rating - 4/5]",4,"1.

"Broken griddle upon arrival.: This griddle is nice but it was delivered and assembled by Lowe’s secondary company. I thought I was ordering from local store but no it was a 2 hour delivery time to my home. They delivered and didn’t inspect before leaving. I go to season the next morning and it will not season properly. Turns out the griddle pins have broken away from the welding to hold griddle in place on one side. 

On phone for 2 plus hours holding them arrange for a pick up a week from deliver date and still no replacement griddle. 

The delivery and assembly was free but I am sure it was included in the cost. 

It is a good looking griddle but if you have a skill set then you should put it together yourself.  It was too heavy for my husband and I to assemble and load so that is why I did not do it. 

The gal on the return line was very nice but still no griddle. It seems you have to wait for pick up on the return and then reorder which is bad business practice when you know it is your fault.

"Great product overall: Soooo I ordered this for delivery against my better judgement, it arrived literally smashed, bent, broken and scratched. You know the bar is low for delivery when we factor in time to have to drive it back to the store before it’s even delivered. CDT & the store was not helpful over the phone (also anticipated) and offered to pick it up/Re deliver the next week… Naturally, we loaded it up & took it to the store ourselves to exchange it but they didn’t have any assembled in stock so we got one in a box, went home and put it together which wasn’t as excruciating or tedious as we expected. 

I know most of this review is focused on the process of buying more so than the product itself—but I do think it plays a role in deciding whether or not to buy!! We love the blackstone itself and have already made a ton of different stuff but you’re probably best off getting one in a box or having a boxed one delivered if you are unable to transport a big/heavy box. I included a couple pics—note that delivery thought nothing of the fact that the lid was halfway off fresh out of the truck.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"This is a review about Lowes, not Blackstone.: I haven't used my Blackstone yet, but I'm excited to learn how! 

My last two Lowes deliveries, however, have been dented. First it was my refrigerator with dents on the freezer and door (they also took my old refrigerator that I had planned to keep). Now the front tray and bottom shelf of my Blackstone were delivered dented (it was delivered assembled). These things aren't cheap so it's a bit of a let down when they show up damaged.

"Impressed with the Blackstone so far !!: Wife and I went in to buy yet another gas grill - seems we buy one about every 5 years - we have bought cheap and weve bought expensive - they all rust and breakdown all with good intentions of keeping fully covered in the outdoor elements - but none the less - We were in Lowes buying our next grill when we ran into a guy that had bought a Blackstone a month earlier and just raved about it. So we pulled out our phones and started researching them right there in Lowes. Different options for the Blackstone but after looking at them all - We wanted the larger surface grill area as I really think most people would and didnt need all the other extras on the other models. This one has the Lid which we wanted - SO onto the review of the grill - This thing is heavy - took about an hour to put together , will need help getting the main unit on. As other reviewers mentioned - DONT TIGHTEN ALL THE BOLTS FULL UNTIL FULLY ASSEMBLED. Once assembled then tighten , all bolts lined up fine for me. As others have stated the lid is a little flimsy compared to the rest of the unit, could be made with a little thicker metal, but its fine for a lid. My wife did a 5 part season , watch some videos and you'll understand. Cooking --- this thing is the bomb - food does taste better - weve cooked entire meals at once - Breakfast (eggs, sausage, hashbrowns), street tacos, cabbage, onions. Made hibachi rice and noodles - so good, steaks have that blackened look and taste. - Must insert here my wife is the Chef, I just put stuff together, lol. Clean up is easy and all that oil doesn't get on the cooking elements and should last longer - we did buy a cover in hopes of attempting to make it last longer. Our new home was plumbed with Propane so we have a line and don't use the propane tanks. So at this point no negatives. You can cook healthy by using healthy oils although butter can be addictive at giving the better taste.  If you dont run into somebody like I did then I think its worth looking into - Think you'll be happy and also might write a positive review. BTW this is not a paid review , but if someone wants to throw me some free stuff , I'll take it :)[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Tips for easier assembly: Great product, flawed instructions:  

First, on page 7, the list of components fails to mention the four brackets used to mount the side shelves.  

On page 8, though each of the four legs is numbered 1-4 there is no reference to those numbers in the instructions.  They are as follows:
#1 is Left front, #2 is Left back, #3 is Right front, and #4 is Right back.  Now, was that hard?  *sigh*

On page 10 it shows the lower shelf being installed flange side up which is incorrect.  It should be installed flange side DOWN for maximum strength (note, the sticker with model and S/N is on the underside of this shelf so make a note before installing it!)

On page 11 it shows the propane tank support requiring a bolt AND NUT which is not on the parts list.  The nut is NOT required, the bolt is one of the 53  M6x12 screws included.

Page 13 - Step 12 says to ""loosen the bottom two screws"" but they have to be REMOVED to proceed to the next step.

Two other pages have non-assembly errors.  On page 3 they list ""Meat cooking temperatures"" and three of the five give incorrect advice (FYI, I'm a former federal health inspector):

Poultry should be cooked to 165F but their statement that ""juices should run clear and flesh should not be pink"" is incorrect.  That's a common myth.  Tests have shown that juices can run clear at lower than safe temperatures and that flesh (especially close to the bone) can remain pink at safe temperatures.  A thermometer is the ONLY way to determine the safe temperature for meat.

The second for ""Beef or Poultry Hamburger"" is correct for beef but NOT for poultry, ground poultry needs to be cooked to 165F and again the color of juices and meat is nonsense.

Finally, ""All cuts of pork"" advises cooking to 160F.  This is hockey-puck territory and totally unnecessary.  Modern whole pork cuts are perfectly safe if cooked to 145F.  Again the nonsense about the color of juices!

The last critique is on the propane safety information on page 17.  They leave out a very critical piece of information that many may not be aware of.  Propane tanks must only be transported, stored, and used in an UPRIGHT position!  They must NEVER be positioned on their side or upside down!  Doing so can result in a catastrophic release of liquid propane!

Hopefully, these tips will be of some help to future customers and I will be providing the same feedback to Blackstone.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Bad Experience: Terrible Experience.  I Was Supposed to Pick It Up On May 28 But Wasn’t Notified. Finally Got a Text and Email to Pick It Up on Wed Jun 2. After Showing Up on June 2 from Brooklyn (40 Mins away), They informed Me that the Unit Wasn’t Built. So, I Was Assured that It Would Be Built by June 3.  I Went to the Store on Sunday June 4 to Pick It Up and I Was Informed that Supposedly, My Grill Was Hit and Dented and Wasn’t Available.

"Assembly And Startup Review: Purchased new 36"" Blackstone on 03/16/22 @ Lowes in Owasso, OK on sale for $449. Pickup at store, not delivery. Upgraded from the portable 17"" model I had used almost daily for 3 years while traveling. Box was in good condition with only minor abrasions to the cardboard. The box is large and you will need a large SUV or pickup to transport it home. All parts and documentation were in the box and packed correctly. No parts were dented or scratched or missing. All paint was perfect and flat with no run areas. Assembly was straight forward using the included directions. All hardware worked and all parts lined up correctly. It is important to be careful and take your time during assembly and make sure you are putting the correct items in the correct orientation. Loosely fit items before tightening them as you will see that some screws should be tightened before others to make the parts fit correctly. Use the correct tools as the screws can be hard to access for tightening and you risk stripping them if you don't use the correct phillips head. You will need a helper to get the main grill body and steel flat top out of the box and to turn the grill over after attaching the legs. You will need a soft surface to place the large grill parts during assembly so they don't get scratched. The grill fired up immediately and the grill surface took seasoning perfectly. The is a 100% winner for assembly and startup. Zero issues.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Griddle: I have always used a traditional charcoal or gas grill but after using the griddle I may never go back.  It is so much more versatile than your standard grill.  I can cook my burgers and dogs on it but also sautee my onions and peppers and cook bacon as well.  Easy to use and clean, and evenly cooks food.  This model has a large cooking surface for lots of burgers and dogs and other foods (we did chicken on it the other day too).[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE.

"Great product if it did not come damaged: This is a very well constructed product. The materials are very high quality and the instructions were extremely clear and well organized. Unfortunately, it was clear just from looking at the box it was shipped in that the item would be damaged. There was crimping on the top of the box and upon opening the package, I noticed that the hood had dents on both the top and back fins. I have been unable to get in touch with Lowe's regarding this due to extremely long wait times with customer care. I would definitely recommend this product, just be sure to examine it for any damages.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Griddle is nice. Free assembly was disappointing.: I ordered this with the free assembly by Lowes. This thing was delivered missing the grease trap and the entire front storage shelf. It is not exactly inconspicuous. It is almost 3 ft. long and says Blackstone on the front of it. I don't know how this could've been cleared to be ok to deliver like this. I talked to the local store to get the parts, which they offered to take from a floor model, but none was available. Luckily the Blackstone customer service is awesome and send out my replacement parts with almost no questions asked.

"Fantastic griddle.: My wife got me this for Father’s Day. I assembled it, which was pretty easy. It took about 2 hrs tops. It is much sturdier than the display unit at the store. I seasoned the grate about 4-5 times. Used canola oil first. Then vegetable oil. Then olive oil. Then canola again. It seasoned nicely. The front edge is still the least seasoned area but will eventually season dark like the rest. I’ve cooked on it probably about 20 times so far. It’s fantastic. And everything we’ve made had been so good. People say that the 36” 4 burner goes through propane fast, but we’ve been fortunate so far. I also don’t usually have all four burners on at once though. I tend to have 2-3 going for different heat zones. The only thing I don’t care for is the tray on the front. It doesn’t have long enough pins to protrude into the holes to hold it in place,  so sometimes when moving the grill the tray will come loose and drop all the stuff in it. I am gonna try to adjust the pins and hopefully that will help. Overall the Blackstone is amazing and you will love it too. Definitely buy the biggest one you can, because you will regret getting a small one. I’m glad I have the 36”!![Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Couldn't be happier: We bought this for the 4th of July party we held. Little over 40 people came this thing helped us out so much. We were able to cook up incredible amount of burgers and hot dogs at the same time. Then for breakfast it was such a blessing to be able to make the eggs bacon sausage and potatoes all at the same time. Nothing was overheated nothing not heated enough no parts falling off.

"Awesome grill: I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  We can’t wait for him to cook up some delicious food. However, don’t make the mistake I made and ask for it be assembled.  Since it was a gift I was trying to save my husband from having to put his own gift together and that backfired.  When it was delivered the grill was scratched in multiple places, had a dent on the hood, a pin was missing from the hinge holding the hood on, and I found 2 misc. screws in various places.  The base was shakey and the grill was obviously thrown together.  I had it delivered to  my mother’s house but if I had seen it, I would have refused it upon delivery. We ended up returning the grill and bought one in a box that was scratch free and my husband put it together properly.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Looks and works like a million bucks.: Sturdy, attractive. I like the new reinforced lid that resists twisting. The front tool caddy seems poorly engineered- water doesn’t drain out naturally. Still, that is not why I bought this and everything else is spot on.

Having used exclusively cast iron in the kitchen for the last decade I’m used to seasoning the cookware. This is so much easier since it’s outdoors. As I seasoned it (10 coats) I found It to heat very unevenly but as I’ve cooked several times on it, including smash burgers (insta-success) it seems it doesn’t matter.

"Not the same: While this is sold under the Blackstone badge, it has been made specifically for Lowes and is not the same product as you will get from other dealers or Blackstone themselves. Including the seasoning process, I had not even run a full 15 pound propane cylinder through it before I started seeing falling paint on the frame with rust under it as well as little fit and finish issues. The few times I did cook on it I didn’t have any major issues with the performance but long term I could tell that it wasn’t going to be worth what I paid for it and ultimately returned it for a refund and bought another from a different dealer. May not be a big issue to some but I wasn’t willing to let it go past the 30 return limit for items that had been used. Not necessarily a negative for Blackstone products as a whole, just ones built to a lesser standard.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Flaking paint and no fix in sight: I purchased this at the end of July 2021. The lid and body started flaking paint within 30 days.  I purchased a Blackstone cover and the grille was never left uncovered.  It appears that heat resistant paint was not used because the paint started bubbling.  If you read the reviews many people have this same problem.  

I contacted Blackstone and the said they will order it for me and replace for free.  They both are on backorder 3-4 weeks.  It has now been 6 weeks and still no parts and they have no idea when I will have them.  

Now the flaking of paint is on the inside of the lid and is falling down into my food when I cook it.  

I would not recommend this product because it is made very poorly.  You have to grab the lid bar in the middle or the lid starts to bow and will not raise.  Some of the bolt holes do not line up.  The paint is the worst I have ever gotten on a grille.  I do not expect this product to last more than a couple of years once I get the replacement parts.  Not what I was expecting from a $600 purchase.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Great to Cook on but was an Adventure in Purchasin: This is a great griddle and I love cooking on it. It was fairly easy to put together although the videos on youtube don't match the assembly of this particular griddle. This one comes with the legs detached and you pretty much have to assemble everything. Still it has been worth assembling it.

The adventure came this past Saturday to purchase it. It had raned and even snowed ( Uncommon for Tucson) and I had gone in the afternoon to get it. It took them almost an hour once I re quested one to bring to me because the didn't have any on the shelves inside. The box was so badly damaged I had mentioned to the  person helpimg me that it looked water damaged and he said it was probably alright. I got it home and didn't take it out just opened the boxx and sure enough there was standing water in the box. 
So I called Lowes and they were great and got another one and had it waiting for me only to find it too had water damage with water inside the box. 

Finally the 3rd time was a charm and got one from the middle of the pile which haad a slight amount of damage to the bux but when I opened it everything was dry and I took it inside piece by pie to keep it from getting rained on overnight. Assembled it the next morning and cooked breakfast on it after seasoning.

In short while I was not happy to have made a 2nd trip back to Lowes the clerks and customer service people were great and got me one that didn't have water standing in it. I would most definitely urge friends to get one of these[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Cooks Great but…: The griddle itself is great!  The stand it comes with is questionable.  The areas of the stand directly under the griddle have rusted in less than 4 months.  I purchased the cover and always put it on.  The product has never been in the rain without the cover.  My guess is the heat ruined the paint.

"Rusted out after just 1 year.: I bought this blackstone because I have the smaller traveler edition for our RV and it works well. This model is a complete dumpster fire. Rusted out in less than a year. It's not even the flat top part its the entire rest of it the frame, the entire thing. The griddle part is mostly good but the rest of it is a mess.

"Buyer beware poor customer service!!!: This grill was purchased as a gift for my father in law and i was tasked with assembly.  Exterior box arrived undamaged so unpacking began.  As I began removing items, i came to the lid and observed a very obvious dent.  Strange was the dent was from inside the lid out not as if the package was crushed in shipping.  See pics.  Called and sent photos to customer service and was told since this is only cosmetic we will not replace the lid but you can pick a $35 accessory for your troubles.  I stated the lid will cost much more than that to replace and we do not need the accessories.  They said that is all we will do.  So you buy a premium brand grill for $400 which arrives damaged by blckstones packaging and just have to deal with the eyesore dent right up front on the lid under THEIR name!  What great advertising to friends.  Hey check out my awesome new grill and it comes with a free dent.  Not what i expect from a premium company.  And not Lowes fault.  Will purchase from lowes but not sure i would reccomend blackstone just on principle even though they cook great.[Rating - 2/5]",2,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

Love this product: Purchssed after issues with my traditional propane grill. Starting to really enjoy using.

"Great Function, Awful Assembly, Shelves Too Hot: First the bad stuff: This thing is an absolute (rhymes with rich) to assemble. The top is cast iron and weighs a ton, so you will definitely need two people to place it. And the bolt holes in it do not match up with the ones on the base, so not all the bolts can be placed. The control knobs are incredibly difficult to push on and there is no indication in the instructions as to which way round they go, so that's just trial and error. The gap between the cast iron griddle and the heating elements is at the same place as the top of the side shelves, so anything plastic placed on the while you cook will melt (ask me how I know), and anything metal will be blistering hot. The propane tank holder is a nice touch, but is too small for the regular sized tanks, so it sticks out at an angle and looks odd.

Now the good: This thing functions perfectly. The cast iron top is huge, distributes heat beautifully, and is very controllable. And it is SO much easier to keep clean than a regular barbecue grill.

All in all, a great purchase that I would highly recommend. Just took one star off for the dodgy bolt holes and the shelves being useless while cooking due to the heat.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Propane regulator: Cooks great. Only issue is the regulator has a very sensitive flow limiter. If you turn the propane tank on more than just a smidge when lighting it shuts the regulator right down to a trickle. The trick is to barely open the valve, light 1 burner, open the propane valve half way, light the second burner, then you can turn on the propane tank all the way. That’s why I gave it only 4 stars.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is NEUTRAL.

"Poor customer service: Received this for Christmas from kids and wife. Upon assembly could tell the lid was bent or deformed from the get go. I’m thinking a stamping error. It wouldn’t lay flat on a flat surface. Installed anyway and it didn’t open and close properly. Called and was told that’s how they are. You have to make sure you use the center of the handle when you use it so it doesn’t catch or oil can. Still doesn’t work. Took pics, took video, no response. Ignored. I know it isn’t supposed to be this way. The one on display at Lowes works fine. Sure would have been nice if they just offered to replace the lid.

"Very disappointed: We brought this grill home and my husband just put it together. 
The lid is absolutely horrible -- a complete failure on the part of Blackstone. It is flimsy and got dented during installation. It doesn't lift easily unless you grab the handle right in the center, it's not easy to get off and the way it hangs on the back, it sticks out a whole foot. In addition, it doesn't lock in place and I'm sure any gust of wind will bring it down on you when you're cooking, which is hazardous. Because of the way it detaches, you will have to decide before cooking whether you want it on or off unless you want to wrestle with a hot lid. In addition, the position of the basket on the front makes the shelf pretty much unusable.
Sorry to say that he was excited about this purchase but now would like to pitch the whole thing. He feels like it was a huge waste of money. I hope the cooking makes up for the horrid design flaws.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Wonderful griddle - great updates: This griddle is the 2023 model. It has a lot of small fixes from previous models that make it noticeable after you research all the options online. It took about 75-90 minutes to assemble.

"Get one, you will love it!!!!!!: This unit will cook just about anything I want. It is built like a Sherman tank. If you have a pick up truck or trailer, I would elect to have it assembled by the store. It weighs 187 pounds and is quite a pain to put in and take out of your vehicle in its box. Been there, done that and won't make that mistake again. It also takes some body maneuvering to assemble the unit. That said, I love the Black Stone grill. It is easy to move around and has plenty of usable amenities suh as a trash bag holder, paper towel holder, magnetised utensile panel and a great storage tray for all of your spices, oil and such. Great for the family get together cooking a big breakfast, a lunch of burgers and hot dogs, and a dinner of fajitas and all the fixings.  Definitly get you one, put your apron on, spatula in hand, fire it up and get cooking. Love it!!![Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Want some rusted meat?: I purchased this grill back in late April due to the positive reviews, wanting to try something different than a standard grill. I do like it for the most part, but after having it covered for a few weeks due to the endless rain we had in Texas, I went to grill the other day, and a large spot was rusted. I went to scrape it and large amounts of rust started coming off. I was astonished, as I hadn't done anything differently. The grill had been properly seasoned, and had been used at least three times prior. Is this a common occurrence with this product? As you can can see in the pictures, the first is the large spot of rust. After MUCH apple cider vinegar to eat the rust away, along with a drill wire brush, and soap spray, I finally removed most of it. I feel that this is not acceptable. I will have to re season this, which isn't difficult, but none of this should have happened. The grill was covered the entire time, with the Blackstone grill cover, which is a high quality cover. I'm not so sure at this point that I would buy another Blackstone grill, or recommend one.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Pretty good overall, not without faults.: Most of the grill is very good quality and then there are a few questionable parts and head scratchers.  Lots of assembly and some of the screws it is physically impossible to get them tightened because you can't get a proper driver in place.  

My biggest complaint is HOLY PACKAGING.  Awful... boxes within boxes, plastic, styrofoam, cardboard beams... just way too much.  I say this because its taken me 5 garbage loads in my HOA (stuffing as much as I can in the bin) and just finally got it all out of the garage.  If you live in a place with a very picky HOA, you will have problems...  The packaging is large and there is a lot of it.  You need some space to assemble but also to store the crap so you can get rid of the packaging.  

I've enjoyed using it and the food has been very good... but dang, packaging and some of the locations for screws and things were my two biggest complaints.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is NEUTRAL.

"You'll love it!: I love everything about this griddle except for the hinge pins for the lid, that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. They are very flimsy and are already bent (came that way in the package) and I don't think it will be long until they break off, then I'll find out how good the warranty is. Other than that this thing is fantastic. I use it 3 or 4 times a week. I've made steaks, fajitas, tacos, breakfast, quesodillas....everything turns out great. Love it a lot more than my not so old Weber grill. It's easy to clean and other than the lid everything seems to be built very well.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Follow this simple tip and you’ll be fine: I literally dragged this thing out the back of my vehicle and assembled it in my living room by myself. That being said, it’s an easier job with 2 people or if you’re not strong at lifting things because the real weight is in the steel cooking space and it’s rather heavy and awkward trying to lift by yourself. It can be done if you’re strong enough but I’d recommend a second person if one is available. The only true tip to assembling this is DO NOT TIGHTEN YOUR SCREWS TO THE GRILLING STATION UNTIL YOU HAVE STARTED THEM IN EVERY HOLE. This will allow you some flexibility to move the legs if you need to find the hole for the screw. This is the only tricky part about the assembly. It was about an hour 15 minute job for me. I took a break to clean up as I assembled. I haven’t cooked on it yet but I’ve heard nothing but good things about these griddles.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

While putting the grill together i noticed every piece was scratched or paint scraped off. Pulled the griddle out and it had two big gouges. The lid was ver flimsy.

Shout to my Local Lowes: First let me say the griddle is awesome!  Does everything that I need it to do.  I do want to warn people that carry one home in a pickup.  The cover lid is not bolted on the cooktop.  It is made removable.  I did not know that so when I headed home with my new grill the lid flew off.  Now let me say a very big thank you to my Local Lowes Store I spoke to the customer service and told them what happen and the exchanged the flatten runover cover with a new one.  That made a very happy customer and my wife as well because this was her gift to me for Christmas. Thank you Midland Tx Lowes!!![Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Had many problems with Lowe’s.: Good product but Lowe’s needs to step customer service up. First grill was smashed in so had to drive 4 hrs to take it back. 2nd one was supposed to be put together but when arrived it was still boxed. They had to re order one to replace the first one. Great grill just many issues with Lowe’s. My card was charged 3 times for my order so I had to call my bank to  reverse the charges. This is my second grill from blackstone.  We have one for our camper and had to buy a bigger one for at home to use on the deck. Easy to put it together.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Cooks great. Built like junk.: Grill cooks it's butt off, however it is rife with poor build quality and engineering issues. The way the frame is built on this model to accomodate the front shelf makes the frame weak and wobbly. The whole grill rocks with just light touch. It's terrible while cleaning. Due to this the shelf pops off quite easily and mine has hit the ground at least 5 times. The side shelves get hot enough to melt plastic while cooking and also hot enough to make the magnetic strip on the left shelf peel right off. Another flaw on this model is the tank bracket which is two inches too short and causes the tank to sit at an odd angle. Definitely not happy with the build quality on this Blackstone.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Game changer!: This was an early father's day gift, and it's been terrific! We had been using regular charcoal grills, but this is a game changer!!! Flat griddle, lots of space, cooks everything evenly, easy cleaning and maintenance, locking casters, adjustable shelf and paper towel holder....it's been a breeze and a pleasant to cook with this thing! It feels well-made and not cheap or rickety like some other grills. Also, getting the Blackstone grill cover to go with it is totally worth it, waterproof and covers the entire grill top to bottom. 

Only thing I'd say I disliked was I noticed certain hardware holes (they pre-drilled) were slightly off as far as measurement, so the hood fitment over the griddle plate was not a perfect line-up, but I was able to correct it.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"A must have griddle.: This is an excellent grill to own, can cook every day and every meal on it. Assembly was easy, took around 30 to 40 mins and make sure you don't tighten the screws until all the parts are assembled.
Seasoned with veg. oil 4 times and was ready for grilling. If you are deciding between a 30"" or a 36"", then it's a no Brainerd, go with 36"". That extra real estate on the grill helps to cook more food and faster. Over all the build quality is good, hard cover is there to cover the griddle and the front adjustable shelf to hold stuff is a life saver. Since the side shelfs get hot, you may not be able to put any plastic things there so this front shelf can hold all the condiments. A must have![Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Works fine. Sub-components are lower quality.: This is my second Blackstone. The first was purchased directly from Blackstone. This one was purchased at Lowe's. It's no secret that brands like Blackstone (and many others) make different ""versions"" of their products for various distribution channels. My first model went together very cleanly, with quality components, etc. That was not the case with this one. Holes were slightly out of place, the pre-drilled spots for the screws were not big enough to acommodate the screws. And other things along those lines. The stand isn't as stable as my other model.  In the end, it works. The surface is good, which is important. It just doesn't have the quality feel/construction that I experience on my other Blackstone.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1.

"Hottest grill around.: This is an awesome grill.  If you want a HOT grill fast, this is it.  It is ideal for searing steaks or burgs or whatever.  Mixed veggies come out crisp and have. Better texture.   a perfect grill for teriyaki anything.  In mins. Cleaning is easy.  Scrape like a restaurant into the disposable drip pan and season.  Done.  .  Well built and simple.

Horrible: Started of with regulator issues……. I would definitely go another route unless this is something you use several times a week. If you are a casual grilled then this will not last.

There is no support to keep it from twisting when lifting it up and down.   After it heated up, it warped and no longer sits flat on the grill.

Mine has issues: The one I purchased and assembled cannot use one of the side shelves because one nut welded inside the body is the wrong size and the M6 x 12 screw will not thread in so I cannot attach the bracket. Also the lid is out of whack. I cannot remove or put the lid back on unless I take the bolts off. So if you end up with one like mine and don’t mind only having one shelf and either always having the lid on or always off go for it. Haven’t yet been successful with support so I’ll probably end up returning it.[Rating - 2/5],2,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

Better deal because of the attached lid: We picked up the grill for our new deck. After shopping around the many models of the Blackstone grills we decided on this model.

Crappy company for what you pay for: Bought this for my son in law for Father’s Day. He had used one before and was so excited when it arrived. Put it together and tried to use it the next day to season the top.Igniter would not start. Had trouble finding long enough lighter then matches to start it. Everything was put together correctly. Emailed the company and still have not heard from them. That was almost two weeks ago.

"Amazing grill with a terrible frame: Amazing grill and burners HOWEVER... The frame that the burners and griddle are set is an absolute engineering abomination. It was literally like they took the cheapest pieces of scrap metal, bored some threaded holes and called it a day. It wobbles more than the wacky arm inflatable guy at the used car dealership down the street and he probably has a more rigid foundation. I was severely disappointed. The screws literally shook themselves out when we took it camping only an hour away ( firmly secured ) I shouldn’t have to re-fab my own frame and have a friend make some additional welds for support.

"Take you time assembling and very heavy: What I did like about the griddle is how quickly the flat top heats up and cooks the food.

"Hood is not removal like it claims.: I just bought this grill specifically for the large hood that blackstone claims to be easily removable. While it is easy to remove, you can not put back on unless you remove the 2 pivot screws and remount the hood. In my case, it would not go back on despite a few attempts too many that resulted in the lid falling on the ground and getting damaged. More over, when you do remove the lid, it does not hang on the grill without scratching the paint on the back side of the grill.

"Blackstone Griddle - I Love This Thing!: Cooking is fun again!  I was moving into a new house and wanted a grill for the deck.  I had never heard of Blackstone until I saw one in Lowe's and I decided to do a little research, finding lots of helpful YouTube videos.  I then decided to buy one and I'm very glad I did.  After doing the initial seasoning of the griddle surface, I've enjoyed cooking eggs and bacon for breakfast and smashburgers for dinner.

Take the leap: Loving the large griddle top. Easy to assemble. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the lid doesn’t fit perfectly. It is raised on one side when closed.

Worth every penny.: This is a wonderful product.  It’s easy to use and cooks anything you can think of. Our first meal was breakfast. Crisp bacon and hash browns and over easy eggs.  It also cleans up nicely.  We haven’t used our stove in weeks thanks to our Blackstone. I even grilled peaches last night and served them atop some flaky cod. It was delicious.

Between this and my smoker, I may never use my grill again. I'm looking forward to trying my first crack at hibachi.  
The only negative experience I had was that one of the holes for the wheels was mis-drilled and I had to force the wheel screw in. I couldn't get it in all the way so I had to shim all the other legs. Not a huge deal, just a quality cont...[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Terrible service from Blackstone: The griddle I purchased is defective. The body is warped and the grease cup will not insert into its receptacle. I've been waiting for a replacement part for 2 months and it's still on backorder. Too late to return it to Lowe's and Blackstone is unable to provide me with a replacement. Their only advice is to continue to wait for a part and makeshift a way to mount the grease cup. If you don't have to deal with warranty issues, the griddle is probably fine.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

": When we inquired about buying a Blackstone grill the Lowe’s associate said he had to go outside to get it for us.When he brought the box out to us it looked like it had been wet  but we bought it anyway since associate advised they were all kept outside.
Several parts of grill had small areas of rust and the manual was very wet and hard to read.
Fortunately we were able to wipe everything off and have used the grill twice with no issues.

"Awesome griddle: Love it. Just upgraded. Wanted the 30in but that didn’t come with most of the features the 36 has. Only downside was took Lowe’s a hour to find it and assembly was not bad but if you have someone to help will make it a easy 30 minute process. 
All the features are awesome. Magnet holder and then the front storage for bottles is the best thing ever. Only knock is the hood I feel could be a little stronger only reason for the 4. Other thank that great product glad I went with this model.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Fantastic product: This product is great.  It is such a blast to cook on as long as it is seasoned properly and cleaned after each cook you should really have no problems.  The only issue is the small gap between the griddle plate and frame.  If there is the slightest gust of wind you lose one of your burners.  Other than that this product is well worth the money.[Rating - 4/5],4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Love it: I love how much cook room there is! It’s amazing and so nice to be able to cook a full meal outside.

"Great to use for large groups!: The assembly was relatively easy. The only part that requires two people is the top griddle portion. I would recommend making sure the bottom section is in the desired location before adding the griddle section, since it is almost too top heavy to allow for rolling it once it’s fully assembled.

Conversion to natural gas so difficult. Don't try.: I had to return this griddle because I was not able to remove LP orvices and replace with natural gas ones. The heads on LP orvices are so small/shallow they round off easily and cannot be removed. I have never had a problem with assembly of any for residence product but trying to change this grill to natural gas proved to difficult.  I found out my neighbor returned his for the same reason.
