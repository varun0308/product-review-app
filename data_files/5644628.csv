"have it tested before leaving the store: The first one I bought was defective, I think improperly assembled. Assembly was an issue also, it was 2 days overdue, an extra trip, an hour of my time, plus a gallon plus of gas. 
This one I bought for $298, on sale from $349.
I again had to drive to the store, an hour, gal+ gas, to see how to handle the defective griddle. I was told to bring it back for a refund/replacement. Another extra trip, an hour, gal+ gas.

"More Hype Than Quality! Skip buying this griddle.: Purchased a Blackstone Griddle, model 2355, on the Friday evening before Memorial Day weekend 2024. Assembled the next day and attempted to register this unit for warranty online.  Before I completed the assembly, I noticed two significant problems. First, the paint finish on the lid portion was defective with an area that did not get painted. Not only is this very unsightly, but you can bet my new griddle will be rusting on the lid within days of me placing it outside.

Good product but beware!: I love the grill itself. But the knobs do not fit correctly.  But I had already seasoned the grill top before realizing the knobs just won't work.   So now I have to slide the knobs off to to turn the valves on then put the knobs back on to control the heat levels.   It recommends replacing the valves when the knobs don't fit but I am not buying more parts when I just bought the grill plus the valves work fine. The knobs are just defective.[Rating - 3/5],3,"1.

"Where is customer service?: It was fine except for one of the gas knobs that wouldn’t work. I had to switch knobs or pull the knob off and turn the stem.

Awesome Griddle: I have heard about how great Blackstone griddles were so I wanted to find out for myself just how good they were and Boy I was not disappointed. The only thing that I experienced that was bad was that the first griddle had a bad ignition It would not light unless you lite it with a grill lighter and also the knobs malfunctioned also but I went back to Lowe’s and they just exchanged it for me. I also sent a email to blackstone and they sent me new knobs and ignition wires other than those things ...[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Looks Nice So Far: Overall assembly was easy. Did end up missing one screw that goes to the handles of the hard cover (found a replacement). Wouldn't start at first.

"Not worth it: This model isn't worth it. Two burners is not enough to hold a good temp. It also requires you finesse the gas so you get full burn. IDK if it's the regulator or what but it shouldn't be an issue with a $300 griddle. 

The griddle itself is also too thin. It warped after a few uses.
