"Amazing grill, but don’t buy it from Lowes: I absolutely love this product, but I would buy it directly from Blackstone and not Lowes. We had ours delivered assembled, and the top was warped. Lowes said we could return it, or call Blackstone directly. Lowes didn’t care one bit that we were delivered a $600 grill with a top that didn’t close properly. We did call Blackstone, and their customer service is amazing. They are taking care of the problem that Lowes didn’t care one bit about.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE.

Not as good as expected: It’s a nice grill overall but for the price I expected it to be nicer. The first issue I ran into was the holes not lining up during the assembly. I had to drill out a couple of holes in order to get the pieces to go together. The only other issue I have is how it cooks. I bought the carnivore model because it advertised more even heating across the griddle top. Unfortunately that’s not the case. The items in the middle of the grill cook quite a bit quicker then the items on the outside of the grill.[Rating - 3/5],3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Nice and simple.: My initial impression of my new griddle is good. The assembly of the cabinet and accessories was a little fiddly, but was fairly simple. Also, the assembly only required a screwdriver which made things easy. I was concerned of the sturdiness of the sheet metal construction, but it ended up quite rigid. The seasoning process was easy, though a little uncomfortable with the heat. Finally, the cooking was excellent. The griddle heats up quickly and is easy to use. The food turned out great, and I can’t wait to cook on it again tomorrow.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Save the backyard cookout: It’s simple really, throw some fire on the largest flat piece of iron you can fit in the back of a car, add a table and some storage area. Boom you have a gadget that can cook an immense amount of food for a ton of people. Very effective piece of equipment, priced reasonably for your average Joe, and huge, it’s huge. Heat profile is great and the omnivore plate is a game changer don’t buy one new without it, requires a bit of pre care and after care when cooking but it’s the same as anything else, take care of it and it will take care of you.

Performance 10/10 Extra could be better!!!: For spending as much $$$ as I did they could be a little better made.

"Lid isies: I cannot keep the lid on the grill. It pushes down pretty hard on the grease trap and also blocks off the flow of grease to the grease trap.  If I leave the lid on, grease would get all over it.  In order to use the grill, I have to remove the lid every time. Not ideal

"Great new addition to my backyard cookware lineup: I absolutely love this 36” culinary Blackstone!

Directions are thorough and straightforward!

it put out some serious heat perfect searing!

Seasoning, the top was well explained and easy to do.

The only issue that I have, and it doesn’t even pertain to the grill itself, is the confusion when it comes to griddle covers. I bought the exact matching cover for this unit But… it hangs so low that the bottom of the cover sits on the ground and get caught up in the wheels. The picture in the box and online shows the cover ending at the top of the wheels…. But mine goes all the way to the ground and then some.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Blackstone works great: The blackstone itself I couldn't be happier with but the foldout table is a bit cheap feeling on the way it works and sits. Also the ease of putting this thing together was very time consuming and not that simple. I also have a gripe with the lid on the way it sits on the blackstone. I expected hinges or for it to connect and it does not. I also expected a magnet strip to hold the spatulas but that was not included. All in all I'm happy with the way it cooks and it works just fine. Just some small details I wish I'd of known before dropping that much money on this specific one.[Rating - 3/5],3,"1.

"Product = Awesome, delivery, not so much.: I've ordered 4 things from Lowe's since their Black Friday sale 2023. All products and pricing and warranty were a total success. Everything works fine. But with this Blackstone grill, the delivery guys rushed took pictures had me sign his phone and when I was inspecting it, I noticed they had bent the end table. I waved them down before they left and they ran to the truck and pulled out. Very bad delivery team. They forgot my washer and dryer cord before also. Lowe's did put me in touch with Blackstone mfg and the replacement part is on back order but it's being covered under warranty. Lowe's in store online and customer service is awesome. But these delivery drivers either don't speak English or pretend not to when you point out a flaw in their delivery and try to leave before taking responsibility. 3 times now delivery has messed something up. I'm still a Lowe's fan. Just would rather get my own things at pickup from now on. I'll have to buy a trailer now.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Damage and poor Lowes assembly - 2 units damaged!: I really, REALLY wanted to like this griddle.  Wife bought it for me for Christmas.  Had it delivered assembled.  Not only was it damaged during shipping, but the drunk monkey that assembled it put it together anyway, I guess hoping I wouldn't notice that the lid didn't close.  He also stripped and cross threaded all screws.  When I lifted the side table it fell off and the cross-threaded and stripped bolt fell to the floor.  Returned it and the store manager couldn't be bothered to come talk to me.  Picked up a new one in the box.  Upon unboxing I found that the regulator hose was packaged pinched between a piece of steel framing and the 100lb griddle top making it unusable.  In addition the face plate is severly bent.  Contacted Blackstone via their website and nothing.  Didn't even get the ""we've received your message and will get back with you ASAP"" automated response.  Lowes assembly is horrible, Blackstone's QA/QC is garbage, and it looks like Blackstone's customer support is junk too.  I really thought Blackstone was the cream of the crop in griddles but guess not.  Guess I'll check out their competitors.  I'm tired of going to Lowes to return garbage.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

Best tool for cooking anything outside: So far I love it. We just got ours like 3 weeks ago and have already cooked almost all our dinners and breakfast on it all ready.

"Build it Yourself: The grill itself was great, but you get what you pay for when it comes to having Lowe’s put it together. It arrived and all seemed well but later I started noticing a lot of screws were missing and the ones that were there were stripped. Luckily I had extra screws on hand but when you get done putting something together and have hardware left over it’s not just spare parts, and jeez use the correct size bit when putting screws in. Moral of the review is just build it yourself so you know it’s done right, don’t trust the kid in the back to care.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

Will not buy large products from Lowe’s: I had Lowe’s do the assembly and the assembly was an absolute train wreck. Screws were missing screws were cross threaded a shelf was bent. The rubber stopper for the lid was gone so I asked for a new one in the box and I’ll build it myself. I got it home in the back of the griddle was bent and dented. I called and asked for a replacement in which my wife went to get and no one had any idea what she was getting and she was there for well over a half an hour.[Rating - 1/5],1,"1.

"Great Product - But missing wheels: This is a very well build grill, heavier duty than other name brands that I have owned.  The package was missing the 4 caster wheels and Lowes was unable to help.  Blackstone customer service responded quickly and is sending replacement wheel which are estimated to arrive in 8 to 12 business days.  I am impressed with their response time but would have like much faster shipper, perhaps overnight.  The wheels need to be installed before the heavy upper portion of the grill is assembled, so I cannot use the use for the big game. :(

"Best Grill I Have Ever Owned: This grill is fantastic. The wheels roll so smoothly and all 4 have brake locks on them, so no matter what direction you recently rolled your grill you will have 2 locks visible to you. The flat top is big and so easy to clean. 2 things I always hated about traditional grills were worrying about placement of items so they don't fall through the grill grates and having to clean the grates. The flat top reminds me of a hibachi restaurant. We throw small potatoes, onions, carrots, really anything on this grill and never have to worry about losing anything to a grate gap. Clean up is as easy as paper towels, water (if you have some stubborn, stuck on food), and a good flat scraper. The last thing I will mention is that the right side of the grill contains a folding table and a garbage bag holder. The garbage bag holder is so great to have because you can throw anything away without having to walk away and leave the grill unattended or drip something all over the place while you walk to the trash. The extra table is also great, especially if you are grilling a lot of stuff and want to keep things neat, or want to keep the serving dishes close by. I will recommend this grill to anyone who is looking to purchase a new grill.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Loving this beast...: Honestly this thing is bigger than we need. It replaced our old 3 burner with sear and side burner kenmore that rusted out after around 6 years (just after the extended warranty expired, wouldn't you know).  As it turns out, the box with the burners wasn't stainless so the tab the burners clipped to rusted out. I also had to change the heat spreaders and the grease pan that rotted out as well.  My wife loves this thing and has been a cooking beast on it so much I've barely been able to use it! I told her it probably reminds her of when she used to work at the Essenhaus (local Amish restaurant) since they had big flat grills. We've done dogs and brats the day we got it, breakfast the next day and 2 days ago we did ranch burgers (we haven't had it a week yet). The best part about this vs our old kenmore for ranch burgers, I mix in a bag of cheddar and diced a large jalapeño. The grease would catch fire and cause flame ups burning our burgers before since tears in the foil would happen flipping them. Not on this bad boy! Everything we've done on it has turned out and tasted great, even scrambled eggs and pancakes! Couldn't do that on our old kenmore.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Great Griddle: We shopped around a lot for a new grill for my husband for Father's Day. We heard great things about this one and it has not disappointed. We made chicken breasts and homemade french fries on it tonight, easily spreading out all of the components, plus grilling buns and some additional brats my husband threw on, with room to spare. Everything cooks fast and it's easy to scrape back to the trap. Finding a cover was the hardest part- couldn't find local and didn't like the 2-tone ones online. We haven't used the folding table yet but can see this as useful for multi-ingredient cooking like fajitas or stir fry. Planning for flatbread pizzas this week and thrilled to keep the splatter off of our kitchen griddle (backsplash/gas stovetop) for brunch with hashbrowns, omelettes and pancakes. Again, tons of room to spread it all out. We looked at other brands and preferred the cabinet base and foldout table option on this one over what we intended to buy (a Traeger). I think it was also $200 less than the comparable Traeger, which had one less burner and a base we didn't care for.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

I’m IN LOVE!!!: This griddle is amazing!!  It seasoned so easily and it heats evenly across the burners.  This is my first griddle and I’m just absolutely in love.  Be ready to spend some time cleaning up afterwards if you want the flat top to stay seasoned and not rust.  I don’t mind the cleanup so this is perfect for me.  It took me about an hour to assemble by myself but was pretty easy.  Packaging was great and there were no damages.  I highly recommend this product to any food lovers out there who really enjoy cooking and entertaining their guests with amazing meals.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"I was reluctant buying a griddle...: The fact that you need to clean the surface in a special way and re-creating patina to make it non stick sort of turned me off for a while....when we went to our local Lowes they had this big monster griddle standing there...impressive  to say the least...lots of cooking area, lots of storage and a great brand with lots of accessories available! So we ended up taking the Blackstone griddle home...including a cover included  deal!
First time firing it up....I followed the instruction and was surprised how simple that was...bacon on it, steak and chopped onions....Wow, you should have seen my stupid grin!!! Lol...the food slid on that top like on glass....it was a real joy to cook on that griddle!! Ok, now clean-up time...I let it cool down and sit for almost 2 hours....tending to family and guests. My thought was, now I am gonna spend an hour scrubbing that thing...lol...heat on all 4 burners, Luke warm water spread evenly...let it steam a bit...scrape lightly  and shove it in the hole in the back...turn it off...whipe with towel...re-heat...oil it...smoke and turn it off again...light coat with oil...done
..max 5 min!!!!
Ok, now come and try to take away my BLACKSTONE griddle...lol...I dare you!! Fan for ever...never another kind of grill....seriously!!![Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Good grill, but purchase with care: The grill itself is great.  The extended shelf is a nice touch, and the griddle seasons well.

I purchased originally with free assembly and home delivery.  Unfortunately, the model I received was obviously put together in a rush.  There were several stripped screw heads, cross threaded bolts, loose bolts, and a few small missing pieces (washers, rubber stops).  This made the overall grill feel flimsy and cheap.  Plus, the model had obviously been sitting outside in the rain for a while, because the griddle was heavily rusted, and there was rust at the majority of joint welds.  
I ended up taking the first model back to the store, and the customer service employees were amazing.  They assisted me and provided a new in-the-box grill that I took home and assembled myself, ensuring it was done correctly.  
The grill itself would be a 4/5, but Lowe's customer service came thru.  

If you buy this grill, I recommend you buy it in the box and assemble it yourself.  That way you can ensure it's tightened properly and the bolts are all aligned instead of cranking them down cross-threaded with an impact driver.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"99% of the way there... Make lid fit better.: Love the Blackstone but the while the metal cover/lid is a plus, it is very poorly designed/fitted to the appliance. I thought this was just an obvious problem just on the ones that store employees were told to quickly through together for the stores showroom floor and didn't have things perfectly ""square"", but mine doesn't sit flat or flush to the frame at all either (as it should) and wobbles, tilts and rocks back and forth. The cover really helps if you want to make pizza on this thing - yes, Pizza!, but first time tried, we realize the heat has to be turned down pretty low (in case you like a charred bottom crust similar to brick ovens in a pizzeria - we do). This (cover and the faux-chrome plastic knobs which feel a bit cheap for a grill of the expected quality - and cost) are the only things that don't appear to be top-notch. Other than these two minor downsides, we LOVE cooking on this thing. The side table is a must for prep and off-loading your culinary creations.

Make sure you level the grill so grease and liquid items (such as when pouring scrambled eggs, thinner pancake batter) don't just run to one direction or corner of the griddle. Would definitely buy again and/or recommend to others for a great cooking experience.

Get extra grease tins and I recommend the ""fabric"" grill cover to protect your investment from the elements/weather. Also recommend getting the accessories pack such as the spatulas, scraper, tongs, etc.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Am absolute game changer!: As a family of 6 (4 of them being hungry, growing boys), this has been an indispensible tool. There is so much surface area to cook on. It gets extremely hot and it can hold that heat well. Meal prep is so easy by being able to do more at once. We saved an entire hour of cooking on one recipe by not having to use our regular stovetop pans. My one ""complaint"" is that it seems as though the middle heats up just a little bit more than the edges. It's barely noticeable, but it's pretty easy to overlook, especially with the added counter space to help keep all of your meal prep at your side. It came with instructions on how to do the initial seasoning. It was easy to follow and very much like seasoning cast iron. Once done, cleanup is a breeze. Everything scrapes off with a flat metal utensil. 

This was a purchase that we had been putting off for years. I'm so glad we took the plunge and bought it. It's worth every penny!

"Parts Missing or Inaccurate: Just purchased 4 hours ago. I found out this specific model is only sold by Lowes. Upon putting this together I noticed a few pieces (table stopper, hinges) were missing, Additionally the side table in the box appears to be for a different model as this is not compatible with the culinary side table. I will be going back to Lowes and will investigate. Just a warning for folks this model from Lowes may not be packaged right from the manufacturer.

"Love it!: I traditionally always cooked on a grill or the stove. Occasionally I used my giant heavy cast iron pan in the kitchen…if you like the amazing flavor you get from cast iron, you’re going to love this!!!
I was thinking about buying the basic one but this one has the side pullout table and I’ve found I use all the table space. I’ve cooked pancake and bacon. My favorite so far was zucchini, onions, and bell pepper chopped up, sausage, chicken, poppers, and some of that grilling cheese you get in the special cheese area at the grocery store. I like this model because it has a lid. I mostly cook with it up but sometimes you need a lid! Love the paper towel holder and the magnetic tool holder!!!
Don’t cheap out on your tools. I splurged and got the Blackstone set. They’re very heavy duty! Excellent quality. I was very impressed. 
The purchase was well worth the extra table space for me. I fold it up and put a cover on it when I’m done! Less dishes in the kitchen. Nothing taste like food cooked on a griddle surface! 
I’m looking forward to years of enjoying this with my family and friends! Love having the cooking mess and smells outside instead of inside.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Amost Perfect: 1st I have to admit I love cooking on a griddle now.  I don't think I'll go back to a regular grill, at least for propane which is a requirement for my deck.  I've cooked some of the best steaks, burgers, and breakfast on this thing...it's huge too! it makes a pound of bacon look like a snack!  I do have a few gripes though.  1.  The lid does not hang on the back of the griddle using the welded on hooks...well it does, but it will scratch and dent the corners of the metal cabinet.  The cabinet on this series is slightly different that the ""normal"" Blackstone ones and sits a bit wider...the hanging hood will catch the corners and bang them up.  2.  The gray temp adj. knobs have too much play in them, making it annoying to adjust temps.  other than those two annoyances, I do love it and would recommend it...unless you have no place to rest the removable hood if necessary.  it's too windy on my deck to leave it hinged open as it'll come crashing down with a decent gust.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1.

"Paint Peeling: The paint started to bubble and peel after only 2 weeks of using the griddle. The griddle was kept under a cover and was not left in the rain. Also under the fold out table rust was already coming thru. After doing some research on the product, I found that blackstone was not using high heat paint on the griddle. I called Lowes customer service and their advice was to call Blackstone. I returned the griddle for a refund after this as a grill should not have the paint peeling and rusting after 2 weeks.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Happy Father’s Day: Dear Lowes and black stone
I got this griddle for my dad for Father’s Day. In short he loves it. I’m glade that I chose this one. 
I went to 6 stores to find a griddle I liked. The double hinge systems felt cheap, I felt like it would break down. The two burner unit was a good size but I didn’t feel like the burners could keep up with that size of griddle. 
The griddle I chose had a smooth hinge, a lot of griddle space and so far I love side table more then I thought. The paper towel rack could use a friction hold so it doesn’t unravel and the trash bag holder works better with clips. I think the wheels are a good fit for this griddle and I’m glade that they are sturdy. We have used it almost everyday since we got it.

A Beast: This is my third Blackstone and it's the biggest and best. I upgraded to this one because I like the folding side table and cabinet. Like my other Blackstone's this is a serious cooking machine. It's a beast to cook on and the cabinet makes it very stable. The fit and finish could use a little work though. The cover doesn't sit squarely when closed and rocks when you push down on one side. Mine also has some scratches on the cover and dents on the left side shelf. The box that it came in was in good shape as well as the packing materials leading me to believe that the damage was done before the griddle was packed. I gave it 4 stars because of the poorly fitting cover and damage.[Rating - 4/5],4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Great Grill: I was able to cook breakfast and dinner for 16 people for 4 days during a family get together. Eggs, bacon, pancakes, corn beef hash. London broil, smash potatoes, pork chops, chicken, french toast, hash browns, pork loin, broccoli, grilled onions, rib eye steaks, corn on the cobb. It all came out beautifully. Takes a bit of practice to get a sear on the steaks and got to be quick making scrambled eggs, over easy are no problem they flip easily.

"Perfect Grill!: I took my time looking for the perfect Blackstone. I chose this one because it has a cabinet for the propane tank so it’s hidden. I also love the size.  I’ve made chicken/steak stir fry with veggies and I loved how it was all done in like 10 minutes and enough to feed an army! Not sure why but it makes every thing taste amazing….maybe it’s the Blackstone teriyaki seasoning, it’s the best! I also love the extra side table, we use it all the time.  I get so many compliments on this grill and about the food I make on it! Best grill ever![Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Well designed: Once the grill was finally successfully delivered, we fired it up and seasoned it with appropriate product, the grill heated and cooked just as you would hope/want. The rows of flame are spaced leaving the edges less hot which allows slower stuff. The hinged side door required a minor drilling to enlarge the hole so that the securing pin could “secure”. Once tweaked, the side table area works great. All 4 rolling wheels lock down and it can be quickly folded and put away. Nice job.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE
