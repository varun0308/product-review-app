"You Will Regret Buying This: There are so many issues with this mower. The bag does not fit properly so grass blows directly in your face.  If you don't use the bag, grass gets clogged on the chute flap and you have to manually remove it. There is no side chute option on this model. The wheel adjustments do not lock in place and fall down as you mow, scalping your lawn. The plastic grip and cord holders fall off and have to be zip-tied in place.  The mower is mostly plastic and the deck is thin, cheap metal. The back flap that protects you from debris is flimsy and constantly gets caught under the mower.  The self-propel doesn't disengage properly and prevents you from pulling the mower back toward you.  The blade is very low quality and was dull right out of the box.  The engine sucks in dirt and grass clippings requiring frequent air filter changes.  The reason you ""never need to change oil"" is because it burns through it like crazy so you have to add a considerable amount every time you mow.

And here's the best part, despite the use of high-quality gas with stabilizers, and the fact that I properly winterized it, and that it is kept in a climate controlled garage year-round, it absolutely would not start this spring.  It wouldn't even crank.  I bought it last summer and used it maybe 10 times before I winterized it. I had to completely disassemble and clean the PLASTIC carburetor.  This isn't something that Toro will EVER cover so if you don't want to do that every year or pay someone to do it ($100+), this is not the mower for you.  Toro will claim you did something wrong.  Look at their canned replies to the low ratings.  It's always going to be something not covered by the warranty.

I have never seen such a junky mower.  It is mostly made of plastic.  I purposely bought a Toro due to their reputation and Briggs and Stratton was always my go-to but now they are using cheap plastic carburetors that clog up no matter what you do.  Well forget that.  Toro has ruined their reputation.  I regret buying this junk and you will too.  Read the 1 star reviews.  They are completely accurate.  You have been warned.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

Handle is way too short: The mower works great. The probably is the handle is not extendable and way to short. I replaced a Troy Built mower and this handle was a full 12” shorter than my previous one. I’m only 5’7 and I had to bend down to push this one so I returned it. I don’t know how anyone taller could push this one and not have back pain.[Rating - 2/5],2,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Dust and grass in face wow: Just purchased this machine, 5/ 10/024
For the price, Everything on this machine should work with precision.. The grass Catch bag, doesn’t work the way it was design.. Grass is escaping from the top Poorly design.. grass is hitting you in the face at times with dust.
Bag was Properly position on machine.
I saw another review on here with the

Won't start after shutting it off and very weak.: I bought this mower April 10th 2024 read reviews and always heard great stuff about Toro products. Well I noticed it just didn't seem to have much power to it and I had previously had a Kobalt 40 volt battery powered mower. The battery mower has more but than this thing. The most recent time I cut the grass I had to shut it off and move a few things. I tried to start it back and it was like it just wasn't sparking or igniting the gas correctly. I pulled and pulled only to get a little puff of white smoke. Well it eventually tries to start and just slowly starts building up power it takes like 15 seconds after it finally hits to get it to run correctly. It's like it's starving for gas or just isn't igniting the gas and unfortunately it is 1 week past the 30 day return policy. I really think there is a manufacturing problem with this thing I've had much smaller mowers that has more power to it. The grass doesn't have to be high at all and mower just doesn't have the but to cut it and dies then here I go again trying my best to get it to start. This mower is for sale if anyone is interested because I don't want this garbage I have better things to do than stand in the sun pulling and pulling on a mower I paid $400.00 plus for that don't start that is only 37 days old total BS!!! TRASH stay away from this Toro garbage! Toro do the right thing recall this model or send us all a replacement because obviously I'm going to have buy another one and there's no way it will ever be a Toro![Rating - 1/5],1,"1.

"Not great: I have had this mower for two weeks. The first one would not start, replaced it with a new one. Got two mows out of it. On the 3rd mow it died after about 30 feet. With fresh gas and checking oil levels etc. it would not start back up. Felt like it wanted to but couldn’t catch. New mower should not require maintenance to fix that after 2 hours total mow time.

"Junk: This mower is honestly and truly terrible. My biggest complaint is how weak it is. I have very small yard in a neighborhood so, I felt like this mower would be perfect. Boy how I was wrong, it dies just about every 10 feet. I mow my yard at least once a week, it’s not like I’m mowing a jungle. It just cannot go through thick grass no matter how tall it is. Aside from that it feels very cheap kind of like a toy. I bought this mower in March of 2024 it’s May of 2024 and I’m already having problems with it. Very disappointed in this product, I highly recommend staying away from this product at all costs. Everybody I know always told me how “good” Toro is but I don’t see it. In my experience they’re awful and I will stay away for good. I don’t think I can return it now but, I’ll probably just trash this mower cause that’s wear it belongs and, get a something else.

"Total Junk: Don't buy this mower.  It is total garbage.  Everything on it is cheaply made.  The wheel adjustments don't lock in place and fall while mowing, scalping chunks out of the lawn.  Random pieces fall off while mowing, like the handle comfort bar, the clip that holds the cord in place, etc.  The self-propel locks up the wheels and you can't pull the mower back toward you. The mulching bag does not fit properly and blows grass and dirt directly into your face.  The engine design sucks grass clippings and dirt into the engine so you have to replace the air filter constantly.  It burns through oil, which is why they claim you never have to change it because you have to add oil every time you use it. The wheels and connections are cheap plastic. The back flap that prevents debris from hitting the operator is so thin, it ripped the first time I used the mower.   I bought this last summer and used it maybe 10 times.  I take care of my things, I only use treated gas, it has a fitted cover, and is kept under a covered patio during the summer. It's not left out in the weather or abused in any way.  It is cleaned and checked after each use. At the end of the season, I properly winterized it, and stored it in a heated garage.  This spring, when I wanted to use it, it would not start.  I had to tear apart the PLASTIC carburator and clean the cheap, poorly designed cartridge in it.  This will likely have to be done every year.  This after the mower was used only 10 times!  My old mower was used over 19 years and also had a Briggs and Stratton engine.  I never had issues with the carb. I can't believe how far Briggs and Stratton and Toro quality have fallen.  I fell for the positive reviews but you will notice they are all from people that just bought the mower.  Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

"Well Designed, Badly Marketed: My three-star rating is the average of a five for engineering and a one for marketing.  This mower is easy to maneuver, speedy on the straight cuts, and competitively priced.  
The marketing issue is Toro's withholding the side discharge chute unless one requests it when registering the product post-sale, whereupon they say that this will take 3 to 4 weeks.  In the meantime one needs to jury-rig a chute out of scrap lumber.  
Adding insult to injury, they claim that withholding the promised side-discharge capability is a climate change initiative.  Look - I selected a side-discharge-capable mower, I paid for this feature, so for God's sake give me what you promised.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"NOT a guaranteed start: Purchased this mower ALONG with a new gas can AND fresh gas & fuel stabilizer. Added the gas/stabilizer mix and the included oil. Worked for about an hour until it died. Could not it get it started back. Tried at least 20 times ever couple hours. (Yes, I’m determined. I paid $429 for this thing, surely it will work….. right?) Tried the next day. After 12 tries, yay, I got it started!!! Cut for 2 minutes and it died. Repeat of the previous day. Now, a week later and same issue. Can NOT get this very expensive heap of junk started. I am so disappointed in TORO. Left a craftsman that I had for for 8 years for what I thought was a better mower. Boy was I wrong. I should’ve stuck with the craftsman. Lesson learned. Anyone want a free mower? No worries, it won’t start anyway. Disappointed with my Guaranteed (not) start mower to say the least. Now I have to pay someone to come work on my brand new mower.

"A Solid Choice: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall I am happy with the mower.  I've owned Toro products in the past and I have confidence this mower will live up to it's promise.  I hesitated to rate at 5 stars based on what some may consider quibbling reasons but they seem pertinent to me.  First, I don't think I should have to hunt up a manual online; they should have been included with the purchase.  Second, I wasn't thrilled that the side discharge blows to the left rather than the right as most mowers do.  Am using as a trim mower so I have to reverse my direction to finish job.  Last, the adjustment for setting the walking speed of the mower leaves a lot to be desired.  Sliding the coiled wire is a pain and the adjustment seems to change while using the mower.  
     Again, these are probably small points and I am quite happy with the mower.  It has performed well at it's intended purpose which is all one can reasonably expect.  I would recommend the unit to anyone.  As I said; Toro has always held up for me.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Simple Mower That Does the Job: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far, so good. Went together well, no loose bolts, poorly assembled parts, etc... I just started using this today, so I will try to remember to update the review after several hours of mowing. Two initial issues to watch out for: Check periodically that the spark plug wire is seated firmly on the spark plug. Mine came loose after a few starts. I had attempted to start the engine, but it wouldn't do so. I found the loose wire, pushed it back on the spark plug, engine started no problem. The other issue (and this is one I believe has affected others based on some reviews I've seen) is the self-propel feature not working properly. After approximately an hour of use, my mower would no longer self-propel when I engaged the handle. Other reviewers stated their feature did not work at all or the mower would move too fast for them. The drive is variable; holding the handle all the way down should give you the maximum speed. Moving the handle incrementally towards the disengaged position should make the mower move slower and slower. The issue was caused, in my case, with the cable not being adjusted properly. This is most likely attributed to the natural break-in period of anything mechanical. Adjustments are inevitable. My solution was to loosen the nut holding the cable bracket, then move the cable sleeve AWAY from the drive lever you grip. I marked it before I moved it, with a black sharpie so I would know the starting position. I then adjusted it approximately 3 ""rings"", moving the cable towards the engine/deck. Then I tightened it back down. When I tested it, my drive worked fine and my top speed increased, plus I am able to vary from slow to the maximum speed based on the position of the actuating handle. I've included a photo pointing out the nut and the mark I made on the cable. I can't guarantee this will fix everyone's drive issues, but it is worth looking into. It worked for me. Otherwise, I'm happy so far with this mower's performance.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"See above: Lowe's write-up for this product states that it is a ""Variable-speed"" mower.  It's NOT.  The mower runs at a constant RPM and there is no way to control the speed at which the mower moves.  The only adjustment one can make is to shorten or lengthen the cable that controls the speed.  This is similar to one partially letting out the clutch on a manual transmission car so that the clutch constantly slips and doesn't fully engage.

"Great mower and great price compared to others.: Started on first pull, cuts beautifully, is light weight and easy to maneuver around my yard and trees.

"Lower Your Expectations for This Mower: This product, at this time, does not offer the value for the expectations that we had at the time of purchase. 
Issue #1: The mower prominently displays the phrase, ""Guaranteed to Start!"" Unfortunately, all lawnmowers should start when then starter rope is pulled 5-10 times.
Issue #2: On a low cutting length setting, this mower stalls out when the bagging attachment is attached.  We like to compost our clippings, rather than mulch them. This is a disappointment.
Item #3: There is no speed setting for the self-propelled feature on this lawn mower. My wife does the mowing (why we purchased a self-propelled mower) while I trim and edge the lawn. If she continues to slow as she ages (anticipated) and this lawnmower lasts as long as the last one, I fully expect to observe her being dragged across the lawn at some point in the future. 
Thie more is a big disappointment when compared to the expectations for the Toro brand.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Pure garbage: This is a nice Briggs and Stratton engine wrapped in a bunch of cheap plastic. I was excited to get a new mower, read a bunch of great reviews. It got here and I was pretty happy with the way it looked. I went to use it, tried to lower the wheels and realized it was pretty cheaply made. The front wheel assembly barely held on in each notch to raise or lower the cut. Fired it up, easily. Sounded good. Went to mow my standard, normal, level, non overgrown, run-o-the-mill lawn. Two minutes in the front wheel assembly falls from the peg holding it up, gets lodged under the mower deck, gets sucked under and shreds a whole wheel, hits the metal rod going to the other wheel, damages the blades and shuts off the mower. Apparently the front wheel assembly is just a bar with two wheels that pops into two plastic teeth under the mower deck. Suffice to say after I hit send on this review I’m headed back to Lowe’s to drop off this massive dumpster fire in exchange for my money. Stay away from this thing.[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

"21in Recycler Self Propelled Toro Mower: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have now used this mower about 5 times and I would say I’m overall very pleased with its performance. The self propelled feature is a game changer. It feels almost luxurious to simply walk behind the mower! The cut is great. I would say that while the clippings are small, the transition from under the mower to into the bag is not the smoothest. Each time I have to empty the bag there are clippings that have to be hand removed from the section in between under the mower and where the bag starts. Other than that I am quite pleased with this purchase. Good machine and a good price! I would recommend this mower![Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Cuts great. but the Bagger isn't all that great: The mower cuts great it's does the job cutting the lawn into fine pices, but I feel the bagger could have some improvements.

"Exceeds Expectations: Very good lawnmower at this price point. fast  shipping, and we'll protected boxing. Easy assembly. Initial start on 2nd pull. 1st time thereafter. Bag and/or mulching works well. Rear wheel drive is great, and speed can go from crawl to brisk walk, depending on how much you engage the lower bar. I prefer rear wheel drive.  My experience is that front wheel drive mowers loose traction from the weight of grass in the rear bag. Tips: When adding oil for the first time, it doesn't take the whole bottle (approx.2/3). For mulching and/or bagging, don't let grass get too high or set mower height too low. If you do, as with most mowers, you will grass get blow by or stalling. You will then have to start at a higher setting and work your way down. I like that you don't ever have to change oil. Only add as needed.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Extremely Satisfied: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased my Toro about a month ago and have used it 8 to 10 times.  It has started the first pull each time.  There is no priming or choking or throttle.  Its mulching capability is excellent.  It pushes easily if you don't want to use the self propelled feature which when used may be a little fast for some.   It has a Briggs & Stratton engine which is a big plus since my last one survived 24 years and also started first pull every time!  Cut is clean and level and height is easily adjustable. Assembly was just a couple of minutes.  I highly recommend it.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE.

Lack of Service: I have been shopping at Lowe's since I moved here to Hemet (2005 and before in other cities Il lived). I like the store and most of the time the productsare in stock. I ordered a Lawnmower online and sent one of my associates (a female) to pick it up since i was out of town. The lawnmower was in a box on a cart. The Lowe;s accosicated pushed the cart to her and my employee rolled it to the van. No Lowe;s associate offered to help her so my employee struggled to get it in the van. The product in the box weighed 88lbs. My employee weighs 107lbs. She did not ask for help be casue she thought it was her job to load the item. I am just upset that no one offered to help her with loading the lawnmower. I anticipated bringing the mower back becasue of this but we needed it to do some work.[Rating - 2/5],2,"1.

"New Toro Mower: I do like the way it cuts the lawn however when I picked it up the oil for it spilled all over the box and lawn mowers.

"Very dissapointing: Bag design is terrible. Because the bag bottom does not run the length of the frame, a large amount of the bag contents fall out as you remove the small bag.

Worst part is that after less than 60 days and 4 uses at the most, the self-propel mechanism stopped working. Lowe's is not help since, as they put it, I didn't pay for the extended warranty. 

Will update after I get a response from the local Toro dealer.

My experience with a Toro: This was my first purchase ever of a Toro product and I only needed for one corner of my yard that is on a slope. It worked for the first two months and then I couldn’t get started. So by October I stored in hopes that by this year it would be back to normal. Nothing. I have taken it to Toro dealer and as of now hasn’t been checked and it’s going on a month. This lawnmower was used only once a month. And now it’s going to cost me to fix.[Rating - 1/5],1,"1.

"Easy Starting: I enjoy mowing the lawn...but I have always hated the hassle of starting the engine.

The Toro almost always starts on the first pull.  Rarely, a second pull is required.

It is very easy to adjust the height of the wheels by a quick push on the height lever.



The auto drive pushes the mower at a faster than average speed but relaxing your grip on the control bar slows it down.

The gas tank seems smaller than my old mower, running out of gas after about an hour.  Perhaps Toro wants to prevent...[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Not recommended: Bought in August/September 2023.  This is the third Toro mower we’ve owned in the past 15-20 years.  Used maybe 7-8 times, bag maybe 6 on fairly flat and even yard.  Bag has a 1 1/2” to 2” gap at bottom where it doesn’t match up close to frame; grass and leaves blow through.   Plastic piece for front wheel height adjustment has partially sheared and lever appears sprung and won’t stay in position.   I believe plastic piece was metal in previous models and all wheels had adjustment feature which probably distributed load better. Very disappointed that quality has degraded in newer models. Previous mowers were great and we had no problems with them.[Rating - 2/5]",2,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

Needs better bag design: The mower runs great. It is fast. But I don’t like that it turns off every time you stop. You have to restart after emptying the bag.

I had to loosen it to adjust the engagement of the self propel, and when I attempted to tighten it back up, the bolt spun in the handle. The head did not stay in position, so I had to try and hold it with a pair of vice grips which scratched the paint off at that part of the handle.

"Toro 21-Inch Recycler Self-propelled Mower: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This Toro mower has been working great around our yard. It has plenty of power to manage the small hills and inclines around our yard with the variable speed rear wheel self-propel engaged. The Briggs & Stratton engine has one-pull starting, which is very convenient and works as it should. This 21-inch mower is a recycler type for mulching but comes with a nice rear bag attachment. It has no side discharge out of the box, but if needed, you can get a push-in chute that mounts in the bagger outlet shipped to you at no charge when you register the mower. This mower has four-wheel adjustable depth-of-cut with nice wide wheels and rubber treads. The handle can be folded toward the front of the mower by unscrewing the handle knobs and thru-bolts to allow easier storage in crowded sheds, like mine. Overall, I've been very happy with this mower and would have no issue recommending it to others.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"The over all operation of the mower.: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] First of all, I had a hard time getting started because the operating instructions were difficult to understand. There was no operating manual, and if there is one on line I can't find it.
Second, setting it up for the proper height was difficult to understand. I finally figured it out on my own but the directions were misleading. 
Third, being 81 years old and still cutting my own lawn, it self propels way to fast and I don't know if there is an adjustment. Again, no directions. 
Otherwise, I love it. It's powerful and does a great job cutting the grass here in Florida.[Rating - 3/5]",3,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

"Just what I wanted: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Fit for purpose. Great engine so far :-) Easy to put together, but needs the YouTube videos because the manual is not going to get you there. Easy to handle, nice cut, simple to raise / lower with ""one side only"" adjustment. Self-propel is good - I might want a little faster or stronger but right for this mower. 
A little messy to unbag - fact of life - and not huge capacity - just watch it. Doesn't come with side blower but just ask and you can get one with registration.  Do the research on things like how often to blow out / clean / change the air filter, make sure to check the oil each time (it doesn't go fast but super important), and figure out how often you need to sharpen the blades.

"TORO 21 in. Recycler® Self-Propel Gas Lawn Mower: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the first lawn mower I've ever used. Assembly and start-up was easy. The self-propel feature is a life-saver for me and made maneuvering the machine fairly easy. The bags does fill quickly so there is a lot of starting and stopping, but that seems to be the case with any bagged mower. The only issue I've had so far is the mower stopping sometimes while cutting, but I was told that happens when there isn't enough air flow to keep the motor running. I am able to start right up and continue whenever it happens. So far, it has been a good investment. I am pleased with my purchase.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Some problems: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received my 21321 Toro Mower, little worried when I saw a hole in the box. Once I got everything out of the box, the only thing I noticed the cover for the Air Filter was scuffed up.  I put the handles on, put the in the top slots, but couldn't get them to tighten up until I put lock washers on them. I mowed and the height adjustment lever would not stay in place. Fell down twice. I called a service person, closest one 35-40 miles away, and he told me he has had several of these mowers that had the same problem.

"Good mower but.....: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Assembly was easy, starts easy.  Self propel speed is a little fast for some people.  I gave 4 stars because the discharge shoot was not included.  I selected to have it shipped to me(free) during registration, it has been over a month and I still have not received it.  It says no oil changes but, I was an aircraft mechanic and I know for a fact oil breaks down over time.  I will be changing my oil each season regardless of what they say.

"Nice Mower: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought my mower about a month ago and it does a great job. I was disappointed to find out the side discharge chute was not with the mower. I had to send for it separately when I registered the mower. They send it free of charge and we all know that it is figured in the price. The side discharge is the reason I bought the mower. Also, I wish you would make the mower so when you release the handle the mower would keep running and the blade would stop. When I finish mowing, I wash the mower, so I have to run it back to my shed it catches all the clippings because the mower is wet and you have to keep the blade running. Thanks[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1.

Changed oil after seven runs each when new. Toro is pretty fool proof with easy maintenance. Hose the unit well after every three runs. Leave it out to dry before storage.

"The more things change…: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] In high school I had a job at a hardware store. I had to set up new Toro lawnmowers, and deliver them to customers, showing them how to operate them, if needed. I never had a single unit not start on the first pull with the Tecumseh engine and magnesium deck. Now, fifty-four years later, my kids bought me a self-propelled Toro for Father’s Day, and it started on the first pull. It’s nice to know that some things haven’t changed.[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1.

"Recommend buy.: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Used twice since purchase.  Started on first pull, nice cut and easy to maneuver.  Bag is too small for my yard.  Without bag and just mulching the mower gives a nice, neat, clean cut.  Like the guarantee to start for two years;  big improvement over current mower.

Toro mower: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far so good. The mower doesn't come with a discharge attachment but they will send you one when you register the mower if you would like one. Very easy to adjust for mowing and the mulching is great. Have not used the enclosed bagger as of the moment but seems pretty straight forward. The mower also does not have a throttle control for the speed of the actual blade but you control the speed of the wheels very easily with the handle.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1.

"Gets clogged up easy: The mower gets so clogged up due to the discharge design that I have to clean it out by hand 3 times each mow, I don’t have a big yard in the slightest maybe 0.1 acre. I should be able to mow my tiny lawn without having to physically remove grass from the discharge chute and around the blades.[Rating - 2/5]",2,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

BAD BAG DESIGN: The mower cuts very good and clean. It is very poorly designed regarding the bag. No matter how large or small the clipping contents upon removing the bag no matter how careful a very large amount of grass clippings fall out. I don't think who ever designed this ever cut a blade of grass their entire life. I will be returning it. I have been mowing my lawn for decades and never came across anything like this. And I have tried everything to keep it. I can't even hinge the top and push the clippin...[Rating - 2/5],2,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.
