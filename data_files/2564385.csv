"Smoking: I purchased and got the smoker delivered and already built, for Free! The delivery crew was even nice enough to place the Pit Boss smoker in my backyard. I was able to start smoking right away. It is very well made and does not wobble. The Pit Boss app was easy to set up and get running within 5 minutes. The ability to control the temperature and not worry about the smoker getting too hot or too cold was the main reason I chose this smoker, along with the strong materials used.The probe that cam...[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1.

"Great Pellet Grill!: Great pellet grill! It was a relatively easy process assembling the grill. I needed assistance a couple of times putting the legs on. This is the first pellet grill I’ve ever owned or used. I’ve used a gas smoker many years ago to smoke, turkeys, chickens, ribs, and pork shoulders. I never smoked a brisket in it. For my very first cook with this smoker I did a whole brisket, two slabs of baby back ribs, and a whole chicken. Everything turned out perfect. There were no leftovers.

It always has atleast 1 error and shuts down in the middle of the cook so I have to constantly watch it. When I tried to use the app to control the grill early on, it would send the temp down to 5° randomly without alerting me, ruining the meat.

"Defective Everything: My wife and I purchased this smoker at the start of the summer. After starting up the smoker for the first time, we quickly learned that the control panel was defective, causing pellets to constantly feed to the box and the temperature to always increase. Pitboss replaced the control panel after contacting them, which took a month and a half. After installing the new control panel yesterday everything was working fine during my test run. I woke up this morning ready to finally smoke that brisket...[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE.

"Well built except for.....: The Pro 850 is built like a tank. I'm new to smokers  and didn't realize the ash needs to be removed via ""shop-vac""! I thought there was a tray of sorts. Nevertheless, I kept the unit and have used several times in the last 3 weeks, even in very cold weather. I've cooked ribs, chicken and fillets. All exceeded expectation!

I did a little more research and saw the next larger size has an ash tray for easy clean out.

"Useless as a smoker and barely a grill: Heat is in the middle so for smoking you always have to much direct heat and no smoke.  What little smoke it generates flows under the meat and out through the exhaust, it never touches the food. I have added after market smoke tubes but there is no place to put them where the smoke will actually touch the food.   Poor design and a waste of money[Rating - 1/5]",1,"1.

"First pellet grill and I’m very happy with it.: I picked this model for its grill size, robust frame/wheels, hopper size, Bluetooth capabilities, and price. Feels like a robust product mechanically. The app tends to be a bit sluggish and crashes. Interface is a bit weird because the grill’s dial will let you set the temperature by 10 degree increments and the app does it by 25 degrees (sometimes). Admittedly it didn’t impact me a whole lot since I’m only setting temps and checking on a temp probe.

More technology = more work: We have used it 3 times so far. Already had to clean the fire pot out because it wouldn’t light for the 3rd use. I couldn’t get the pot loose from the igniter so not the most convenient thing to clean unless you have a vacuum cleaner handy.

Poor quality control: I was very excited to purchase this smoker/grill. It’s a little challenging to assemble by yourself self but nothing I can handle. Until I got to the wheels. Two of the four legs weren’t fully soldered. There was nothing to screw the wheels into. I therefore had to disassemble everything and pack it into my car then load it into two shopping carts. This was not a fun experience. If quality control had done their job I would be enjoying I nice meal right now not shopping for a new smoker.[Rating - 1/5],1,"1. The overall review is NEGATIVE

Awesome Grill! Slight learning curve: This grill is awesome. A couple of small things I’ve found out since owning it: 1. There is a major hot spot in the middle. Not a big deal just have to be aware of it when cooking. 2. If the rope rack is in the closest slots it can feel a little cramped while cooking.

Buy a Traeger: First time using it was alright. It was easy to set up and get running but the app is hit or miss. Used it again the next day and it shut off three times in a 20 minute span after it had been running for an hour.

Good Grill. Don’t buy for WiFi: Got everything set up out of the box. Everything seems to be working fairly well in terms of the mechanical components but the WiFi will not work and the app therefore is pretty pointless. Only the Bluetooth works which means you have to be within 10-15 feet of the grill for the app to be effective. WiFi is why I went with Pit Boss over Traeger. Seems to be a common problem.

"I love it.: Had the pit boss tailgater for a while but wanted to get a bigger smoker.  It has a heavy duty construction.

When I called the manufacturers line they said that ""This can happen when it gets humid and the wood dust expands"" and sent me a guide on how to break down and clean the auger.

Alot of bang for the buck in pellet grills.: Pellets grills are very versatile. You can use this one like a normal grill. It has a damper that opens to a direct flame. Or you can set it and forget it and allow to smoke. Everything these days is App driven. And this grill is no different. Just another convenience to simplify the cooking process. Would recommend for anyone just getting into smoking. But will give you the very consistent results that experienced smokers strive for.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Best grill I've owned with a small issue: I bought this grill a few months ago and it's the best grill I've ever owned. I love the wifi and bluetooth feature and I love the way my food tastes on this grill. The meat is juicy, the pizza is delicious and this makes smoking fun again. My only issue is you really need to find the sweet spot on the PID to turn the grill on. It's just to the left of the actual power button. I also wish there was a finer temperature control besides jumping 50 degrees after you get to 250 degrees.[Rating - 4/5]",4,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Good,but...: I bought the grill in mid June and have used it several times.  It grills well, and has a good smoke flavor.  The reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is that the temperature settings are too far apart.  The literature says it grills from 180 to 500, but mine starts at 200 and I can't get it above 450.  Also, I like to do ribs at 275, but the only choices are 250 or 300.  If the temperature settings were every 10 to 25 degrees, the grill would be awesome![Rating - 3/5]",3,"1.

Good grill for beginners but lacking: It cooks great but with some adjustments. First you have to block off the temp probe because the heat it blowing directly on it and it reads higher than it is. It only goes up in 25 degree increments to 250 then 50 after that which is super annoying. The app is a joke and sometimes doesn’t send the adjustments to the unit and if it does send them the unit doesn’t accept them after receiving.

Easy bake oven: This is my first experience with a pellet grill.  So far it passes.  Coming from a wood burner this feels like cheating but it’s nice to be able to set it and forget it and have the end product as good if not better than if I was standing over it all day.   It’s so easy and convenient even my wife is using it now.  She would never grill before I got my easy bake oven.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"This is the one.: Went from a Weber Genesis E-330 SE to this... I was very hesitant to move away from propane. Don't hesitate, if you have 5 extra minutes for warm up you're gonna love this grill. Add some grill grates and master every cook. Make sure you warm it up to 350 before backing it down to smoke something, and my goodness the smoke flavor is unreal.

"Great smoker for the price!: Got for Fathers Day for my husband. Used it every night since we've gotten it. Had a heatwave of 100+ degree temps so no cooking in the house. It handled it like a champ! Always kept temp, does vary 5-10 degrees on cooler nights. This is our first smoker and am so glad we went with Pitboss over Traeger!

After I got home, I realized they had just given me the floor model which, I have no idea how long it has been sitting out or who has altered it. After getting home, it would not even turn on.

"Outstanding grilling choice: Seems like the food cook's more evenly, no flame flares created from drippings. Pellets are easy to store. No guessing about the need for propane since your using Pellets. Changing pellet flavor is easy. Set temp is simple for more consistent temp. Solid construction, love the for wheels instead of two.

The temperature adjustment sucks: The grill is nice I like everything about it…other than the temperature. It goes from 250 to 300. That’s just crazy to me. Why would you do that?

"Great Grill, Horrible App: I love the grill. I have used to over 10 times now and have made perfectly cooked steaks, chicken; you name it. The meet probes work great, the meat probes temperature control works great, but there is one flaw.

pit boss pro 850: This seems to be the best bang for your buck. I debated between this pellet grill and a Traeger for months. For the price difference I’d say I won. I’ve smoked mutliple types of meats and veggies and the flavor is fantastic. The option to have an open flame is especially nice for cooking steaks! Maintains temperature very well even in the colder temps. Easy to clean out with a vacuum by removing the grates. I do wish it had a form fitting cover but the universal cover I bought fits great.

"Really 4.5 stars, but that was not an option.: I have cooked on many smokers and I am loving this one every bit as much as the others.  Like every grill/smoker out there, some great features, some not so great features.  Highly recommend this product

Pros
Simple to use.
Great cook on everything so far

Cons
Not enough smoke, Pit Boss needs to add a sliding tray with a built in smoke tube for added smoke.
Temp options should stick to 25 degree jumps.  I really like cooking many things at 275, but this is not an option. 200,225,250,30...[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

"Consistent cooking: Bought the Pro Series 850 in April. Use it at least 3 times a week. Great at holding temp and the searing option with the slider grate is one great idea. 

Cons: Temperature increments. 180°, 200°, 225°, 250°, then it jumps to 50° increments. Wish it was 10° increments to 250°, and 25° increments after that.

It was advertised to have the removable fire box for easy cleaning... in which it does not!

Pit Boss: I have used my Pit Boss pellet grill once so far and with great results. I love the WiFi and Smoke It app. The food cooked great and tasted awesome. The only thing is the smoke flavor is not as strong as my vertical smoke that uses wood chips . I can live with that because the pit boss pellet grill cooks fantastic food . Plus the pellet grill is built to last . A great product.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Easy to use and love it: This is my fist Pellet Grill/smoker. After buying it I sold my electric smoker and haven’t used my propane at all. You do need to clean these more than any other grill i have ever owned which would be a down side as well as the 30-40 min it takes to hit 350 if your grilling. But that trade off is it cooks much faster once temp is reached and the food tasks amazing.[Rating - 5/5],5,"1. The overall review is POSITIVE

Heat up issues.: I have had my 850 over a month now. Did initial burn off. Did my first smoke in 40 degree noticed my set temp to nearly 45 mins. Figured the cool weather had to do with it.

"two briskets, ribs and the Thanksgiving turkey: this pellet grill has continued to exceed my expectations with every cook.  bought it from lowes right before Thanksgiving and smoked a turkey, then two briskets and two racks of st. louis ribs. it has very good temperature control and I'm surprised by the low pellet consumption. you do need to buy a smoke tube if you want a heavier smoke flavor. this grill is built well and the wifi/bluetooth works great ( after the last update). extremely happy with this purchase not to mention 5 year warranty...[Rating - 5/5]",5,"1.
