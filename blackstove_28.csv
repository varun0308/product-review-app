"So much fun to put together: Oh wait…. No it’s not, so to whomever isn’t the factory, please don’t over tighten screws we are suppose to loosen in order to put together, one screw on the shelf system is so tight I can’t get it loose and I’m not a weak guy.",4,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
Awesome Griddle: I have heard about how great Blackstone griddles were so I wanted to find out for myself just how good they were and Boy I was not disappointed. The only thing that I experienced that was bad was that the first griddle had a bad ignition It would not light unless you lite it with a grill lighter and also the knobs malfunctioned also but I went back to Lowe’s and they just exchanged it for me. I also sent a email to blackstone and they sent me new knobs and ignition wires other than those things ...,5,1,0,1,-1,0
"Be cautious when purchasing from lowes: Did not work propane not getting thru would not light. , knobs fell off, had it put together by lowes. I returned it will never buy anthing again from lowes.",1,NA,NA,-1,-1,NA
assembly was horrible: took the free assembly and nothing on this grill works. Neither of the burner dials or the ignite button works. Highly disappointed in Lowes!!!,3,NA,NA,-1,-1,NA
"Great Blackstone: Great grill, perfect size, breakfast on the grill is exceptional, steaks are perfect as are the veggies we grill.",5,1,NA,1,NA,NA
Buy it put together.: First one didn’t come with all the parts so they didn’t put it together the time they told me. Second got it home and it didn’t work so had to drive a hour 4 times. The second one works fine just had to go back again to pick up.,1,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
"Blackstone Review: It was easy to assemble, cooks great and has enhanced the different types of food that I can grill outside.  I like it better than the original gas barbeque. I have used it several times and cooking times are great and it does cook better and faster than a standard gas grill",5,1,NA,1,1,NA
One of the knobs are broken: One of the knobs won’t stay on the Blackstone so I’m having to pop it on and off to use both sides. Hoping to get it replaced. Was a little harder than we thought to put together.,4,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
Absolutely amazing: How easy this grill is to use and clean is truly great. The fact that the manufacturer has videos set up to show you how to get your grill going makes everything easier.  5/5 would recommend anyone in the market to stick with blackstone!,5,1,1,1,1,-1
"Amazing product: I have enjoyed so much different types of food, which has gotten me out of my comfort zone, but it has been nothing short of delicious.  I live in the Pittsburgh area, soI thought I would experiment with pierogies. My experiment yielded awesome results.",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Excellent — No other griddle compares: My new Blackstone is just top notch. Every inch is quality. It outperforms my previous griddles of different brands — no contest. Rear drip tray is absolutely heavenly; it’s one of those things you don’t think about until you experience its ease of use. The cook top seasoned up perfectly with absolute ease, and I just can’t stop cooking dinner on it. I think about cooking on my blackstone at work. I think about it in traffic, I think about it in bed trying to sleep, I dream about it. Absolutely ...",5,1,NA,1,1,1
"Excited: Always wanted one, was given this for Mother’s Day gift. Looking forward to enjoying many meals on it. Haven’t used it just yet, just opened the box. Seems well made and sturdy.",4,NA,NA,NA,1,NA
"Sweet: Picking up this grill was a great choice, despite tough times a grill like this saves electricity and isn't heating up the house in the summer months. We've already cooked burgers, chicken and steaks. My only grandson Leland just started football practice for the first time at 13. This grill will help to ensure his mom can cook the healthiest of foods with the great taste from our new Blackstone grill.",5,1,0,1,1,1
"Havnt used it yet so...: Registered my grill and asked for this review. Only put ot together and seasoned it but so far, so good.  I did a ton of research so fully expect this to be 5 stars.",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Quadruple burger: This Blackstone Griddle has been amazing so far. We are still figuring out the cooking techniques but my son rocked his first burger and it sure was a tall one!!! He can't wait to cook again on it.,5,1,NA,1,1,NA
"Loose knob: Quick and easy assembly, went through the seasoning process and cooked dinner on it, everything was great. The only issue being is that one of the knobs is loose. Meaning to ignite and or turn off one side of the griddle, you must take the knob off and push in the pin with your hand as the knob won’t hold onto it. Still enjoy the product, just a little bit upset about the minor inconvenience",3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"New griddle owner: I just purchased my first griddle and I'm excited to try it out, just as soon as I watch the video and get it set up to use!",5,1,0,0,0,0
"Just got it!: While we like the idea of the griddle we were a little deflated when we picked up our purchase. It wasn’t as hefty as we thought it would be for the price we paid. We assumed wrongly the the wheels had locks and we thought it came with a hood. However we are going to keep it and see how we like cooking with it. Who knows, maybe we will invest in a fancier model at a later date.",3,0,-1,0,0,-1
It is different from most grills: Not sure yet how it works,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Great! But...: I got my new Blackstone and I love it. Seasoning it was quick and easy without much problem. Once I got it assembled though the burner control knob broke and won't go back on. A bit disappointed this isn't better construction. Otherwise I would recommend getting one of these. It is amazing the way food tastes off a flat top. I am also amazed at how much and how fast it cooks.,3,1,0,-1,-1,0
"Best grill: Best grill I ever had! Only one problem igniter didn't work but thats ok I just light it with a lighter, still love it!!!",5,NA,NA,1,1,NA
Great cooking appliance!: A welcome transition from a previous “gas grill” user. Clean up is so much easier and the cook top is extremely versatile allowing more food types to be cooked on “one” surface.,5,1,NA,1,1,NA
"Not worth it: This model isn't worth it. Two burners is not enough to hold a good temp. It also requires you finesse the gas so you get full burn. IDK if it's the regulator or what but it shouldn't be an issue with a $300 griddle. 

The griddle itself is also too thin. It warped after a few uses. 

Would not recommend.",2,-1,NA,-1,-1,NA
"Disappointed: I bought this on sale at Lowes this weekend (March 2024).  I knew this was not top of the line model and was willing to give it a go.  Here are some of my things I found disappointing:
Gouges on the grill flattop (out of the box), these are not unseasoned portions
Flattop not being lined up accurately to fit into pre made slots.  The hole was at least a 1/2 inch off
Flimsy state of the side tables.  The side tables I know will only hold up to 10 lbs, but they slant considerably and anything you ...",1,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
You have to season it first  not hard to do: Cooks  great love it,5,1,NA,1,1,NA
"New to blackstone: I’m excited to get started, grill looks and feels very solid. Smash burgers and eggs /bacon are first things I’m excited to start cooking.",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Great for everything!: Easy set up,easy to maintain,amazing for anything you can think of that you want to use a griddle for! Only downside I ran into was trying to get it to light on the close left close side first it would not start in the very beginning after a few tries messing with the prongs to form an spark it finally clicked on and would work fine from then on not sure what the initial problem was with the left side, even though the right far side would start perfect everytime.",5,1,1,1,1,1
"Really bad experience: Purchased a Blackstone Griddle and had the ""Expert assembly option added"" . 
When the first went load in the truck one wheel feel of. Had a missing nut on one of the 2 wheels. Should have been my signal. The Lowes employee went back inside with bolt and grabbed a nut (non locking as required on a wheel) and added it to keep wheel on. I told them I would replace nut at one with a Nylon locking nut.
Got it home and got ready to season grill. lit 1st burn, no problems and second one would not ignit...",1,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
"New Blackstone purchase: Just purchased this blackstone with high hopes. Not crazy about hanging the lid on the back of grill, the drip pan makes it stick out instead of hanging straight. Had to light it with a lighter as the igniter doesn’t work, there’s a clicking but doesn’t ignite even after troubleshooting.",3,0,-1,-1,1,0
Love it! Not your typical grill: Great griddle! Easy to assemble. Food cooks evenly. Excited to use it on a regular basis for all types of cooking.,5,1,0,1,1,-1
"Looks Nice So Far: Overall assembly was easy. Did end up missing one screw that goes to the handles of the hard cover (found a replacement). Wouldn't start at first. Did the troubleshooting and concluded that the igniter wires that create the spark next to the burners weren't close enough. Had to do a little bending and tweaking; it starts now. Product looks really nice though, and will be seasoning it for the first time real soon. Maybe could update this rating to 5 stars afterwards.",4,NA,NA,-1,1,NA
"Blackstone grill: Great grill easy to use and easy to season. 
The guys at Lowes put it together for me and loaded in my car. Love this grill 
Thank you",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This grill? The perfect size to feed this debaucherous crew some seriously perfectly made grub!  Easy to use, easy to clean and creates the perfect sear on beef and other meat choices while simultaneously, yet gently sauteing delicate veggies on the opposite side. Buy this grill. You won't regret it.  And don't forget to initiall...",5,1,0,1,1,-1
"Almost a 5: Use it twice and love it. Unfortunately the second time, turned it off then decided to cook some more and realized the knob on the right will not turn. Haven't started looking on who to talk to to get fixed, but when it is, it would definitely be 5 stars.",4,1,0,-1,0,0
Griddle top doesn’t align correctly to the base: The griddle top does align properly to the four holes on the frame that it sit in. Because of this there is a need to ‘modify’ the holes so that the griddle will sit correctly on the frame.  Based on several online comments - this seems to be a common issue so the QA process could be improved before shipping these from the factory. Other then that - works as expected.,3,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
"Worked great for a week: I've had it for two weeks. The first week was great - I made burgers, steaks, chicken, shrimp, and various vegetables. All came out good. This week, one of the burner knobs came off and that burner won't light anymore.",1,1,0,1,-1,-1
Easy put together: The easiest grill to put together. Was together in less than an hour. So excited to use it,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Very nice outdoor griddle: Easy set up. Have used it a couple times now for turkey burgers, chicken fajitas, and beef burgers. Hot side Sears really good and low side finishes them off. Also like how easy it breaks down for travel. Perfect size for m needs.",5,1,1,1,1,NA
"Love my griddle: The 28"" griddle with the hard cover and the soft cover is just what I was looking for in a griddle. Just got it today and can't wait until we get warmer weather so I cook on it. Will be looking for a cookbook with recipes that I can use on my new griddle.",5,1,NA,NA,NA,1

Husbands Early Fathers Day Gift: Quality product as far as structure & parts but when we got the flat top on it was difficult because it’s warped but we had to force it and scratch it up a bit but nothing that will be noticeable,4,1,-1,1,1,0
A great addition to the backyard kitchen: So far I’m very happy with the quality and value of the product. It seasoned up perfectly and we were cooking smash burgers in no time.

"28’’ blackstone griddle: Quality control wasn’t that great, there are things that look off especially in the griddle. The griddle also did not fit well the holes were not aligned. I don’t expect this to last more than 2 years.",5,-1,NA,NA,-1,NA
"Yours may be flawed like ours with not lighting on: The grill is nice, but we can’t get it lit by pushing we have to light it with a lighter do not like that part so something must be wrong with it to come out of the box like that",3,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA

New owner: Looking forward to trying the black stone out very easy to assemble and good instructions,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Ok: Barely have got to use it. Ok for now I guess. Assembly was a pain as the bolt hole would not line up. I’m a mechanic so I know a bolt threads in nicely or not. Ended up having to get a line-up bar in the hole and twist on it in order to get the threads to line up.,4,NA,NA,-1,1,NA
"Grilled choice: We had heard good things about this brand. So So far we like it well. It would be best to purchase the seasoning and cleaning pack with the grill initially. We had to make another trip to town for it. After we finally seasoned the first time, we grilled steak fajitas and veggie mix along side. YUM YUM YUM. Happy hubby & happy wife and no regrets!  ❤️❤️❤️",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

Cooks everything perfect!: I've had my Blackstone Grill for two weeks now.  I'm Whole Plant Based so I cook alot of veggies on it.  The Blackstone Cooks them all prefect! I couldn't be happier with it!,5,1,-1,1,1,-1
"It should be great, once it works: I cleaned the grill as instructed and let it dry, I was going to heat it up and treat the top but no ignition, no click or anything.  Also the burner knob closest to the ignition button turns very rough, can't tell of it is actually working at all.  Im hoping Blackstone can help me resolve this so i can start grilling.",3,0,0,-1,0,0

Beautiful and really fun to use!!!! It was a gift: I love it!!!! I think there could be a bit more stability in the legs and wheels but I won’t be moving it much. That’s probably the benefit of spending a bit more on the larger models,4,NA,1,1,0,NA
Excited to try the friddle: This is a new experience. So far so good. I am a little concerned that the lid is not secure on one side. The lifting it off and placing it in the back is awkward and a bit dangerous,4,NA,NA,NA,-1,NA
OUTDOOR CHEF'S DREAM: I've been looking and waiting for the right moment to complete my outdoor cooking team. This griddle is EXACTLY what I've been after.

Love the griddle and Blackstone but igniter didn't work: Love everything about my product as I got it for a birthday gift but upon using it the igniter didn’t work - even after going through the troubleshooting manual and video. Would love to get this part fixed so I can use it as designed.,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Poor Control Knob: Got this yesterday.  Left Control Knob already won’t push in.  Have to take off the knob and turn the stud by hand.  The screw head for the control knob bezels gets in the way.  The work if I install them upside down (see pic),2,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA
"So far so great: After putting it together, I noticed the ignition assembly was broken.  Hopefully Blackstone will help me get it fixed.  I used a grill starter to season it, and then cooked a few meals on it.  Meals were great and I had fun doing it.  Looking forward to more meals on the blackstone!",5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
Too small: We are switching from a grill to the Blackstone. We thought a 28” would be big enough for our cooking. We were wrong. 32”-38” would have been the ideal size to make Japanese Hibatchi meal for 4.,3,0,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Blackstone knobs backwards and low heat: Knobs turn opposite way. Low flames, spent 2.5 hours trying to season the grill. Followed tutorials and manual for regulator bleed, changed out propane tank, and still could never get the grill hot enough to (smoke) using the Blackstone seasoning. Disappointing purchase.",1,NA,NA,-1,-1,NA

Review: Everything looked good. The griddle went together easily enough. It was missing one of the machine screws on the griddle itself to hold the wing on so I had to run to the hardware store to get one. I will season it tomorrow and give it a gothen,4,NA,NA,NA,0,-1
