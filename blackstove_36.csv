Not assembled as promised.: It was supposed to be assembled but pieces were not. The bolts and screws to assemble the pieces myself were not included. The grill had scratches and a small dent on the hood. Looks like it was a floor model.,3,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA
Everything I imagined and more!: Everything came in the box.  I decided to install the black stone myself and it wasn‚Äôt hard at all.  The Blackstone gets really hot very fast and I love how big of a range you can cook different foods on it at the same time.  I love it.,5,1,1,1,0,1
"Box Mangled and Item Dented: Received the blackstone griddle in a mangled box, got home to put it together and right away saw a very large dent in the back. Put the griddle back in the truck and was hoping for an exchange, nope. Had to do a return which is now holding up a nice chunk of cash for a few days or even weeks. No idea why an exchange could not happen in this case.",1,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA

"Instruct your delivery Carefully!: I was pleased with everything - the delivery people kept us current by text as to where they were on the day of delivery. They were on time, put the griddle where my wife asked, and left. I was not there but she said they were polite and professional. 
All was good, until a few days later I noticed a fairly large dent in the front panel, just under the second burner knob from the right. It was obvious and I cannot believe the delivery personnel did not see it.
By then, of course, I had used the ...",1,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA
"Nice Grill Beware of the Professional Assembly: I like the grill but I am not happy with the way it was ""professionally assembled"".  Immediately after  received 2 of the burners would not light, this is dangerous.  I was given the run around by the manufacturer who directed me to Lowes, who subsequently directed me back to the manufacturer.  It's pretty much fix it yourself (note I am 75 years old and have certain disabilities).  To fix this you need to remove the heavy grill, as there is no other way to access the ignitors which were not ins...",3,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA
"Blackstone Griddle: I bought the 32 inch and very disappointed. I've had this less than a year and one of the shelves have already rusted, along with the back part of the griddle itself. It's never been out in the rain because it stays on the carport with a $60 Blackstone cover. I clean that griddle when I get done cooking. So what I paid for it along with the Blacksone cover and Blackstone cleaning accessories I'm disappointed. Would I recommend this, I'm sorry to say no I wouldn't. I hate for someone to put this ...",1,-1,0,-1,0,0
"Junk: Purchased grill, was dented on the body of the grill .Seasoned grill before used,  great to use. Always covered on patio. Griddle is rusted, the paint has peeled  off the body, and the cover is rusted badly. Was excited to purchase a Blackstone, but had I known of the poor quality I would have passed on this purchase. It is a pile of rusted junk and is going to the dump. I guess that I will have to purchase an overpriced Weber now, a grill that I had for years and never had problems with.Also, a...",1,1,0,-1,-1,0
"Horrible Assembly: I had this pre-assembled prior to delivery. I would suggest assembling it yourself.  After it was delivered, I inspected it. The center shelf was put on upside down and backward. I assume it was because they didn't want the reach under to tighten the screws. The propane tank stabilizer was barely on, and the nut was stripped. All the hangers were barely attached. 3 stars only because I believe after I take it apart and reassemble it should work correctly.",3,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA
"Manufacturing issues - no qc: We have been looking at the Blackstone griddles for several months, mainly at the used ones for sale in our area. None if these were in decent shape so yesterday we opted to buy a new on 36"" 4-burner model.
I sat down and read through the assembly instructions, opened the box and did a quick inventory.  I didn't have any real difficulty in putting the thing together.
My problem was in the factory construction.  Within a few minutes, I found that one of the cross members that connects the front l...",3,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA

"Avoid Lowe‚Äôs Assembly!!: This review is mainly about how terrible Lowe‚Äôs is, I love my Blackstone. I purchased my Blackstone online and chose free assembly and delivery through Lowe‚Äôs. When it was delivered everything seemed fine for a couple months because it never moved. However when I tried to roll it to a different part of my deck the whole grill nearly collapsed because only 1 bolt was installed in each leg connecting to the grill. There are supposed to be 4 on each leg! After speaking with 5 different customer ser...",1,1,-1,1,-1,-1
Love! But don‚Äôt let Lowes assemble!: Product is great! Delivery was great! I requested free assembly and it was assembled horribly. Every screw was loose. Screws were even missing. Knobs were installed backwards. And the paper towel holder was installed upside down. Let‚Äôs just say I learned my lesson with their free assembly. It was free for a reason.,3,NA,NA,-1,NA,NA
"Item is very cheap, Blackstone has poor CS: My wife purchased a 36‚Äù griddle from Lowe‚Äôs for Xmas.  We had Lowe‚Äôs assemble and deliver.  The unit was delivered with 10 screws missing.  I was barely able to move it since it shakes so bad.  If you are missing parts all I can say is good luck.  Do not have Lowe‚Äôs assemble, they do not care to assemble correctly.  Blackstone customer service is terrible as well, good luck getting the parts that you need.  As for the product its self, the griddle itself is great and makes an excellent steak.

"Pretty straightforward, but a few build changes...: This was delivered on a Friday afternoon, and I thought I'd be able to build it that evening, but ran out of time, so finished on a Saturday afternoon.

Overall, the build was pretty straightforward. It did take about 30 minutes to unpack everything, and it seems a lot of the complaints about quality may have been addressed. Tons of padding, reinforcing, etc, and none of the dents others had mentioned, though there were a few nicks to the griddle bed in one corner, and the sticker on the left sh...",5,NA,NA,1,NA,NA

"High Quality - Opt for the Pre-built: Purchased the 36in Culinary, upgrading from a 22inch adventure model. The culinary series is Lowes specific and it includes a few upgrades that customers complained on other models. If you don't think you'll be moving it very much, then the wind guards and hood that model are clutch.  It was easy to season, and cooks very well, even with the reduced BTU output. I recommend opting for the pre-built models, if you can transport it. I purchased one in the box, because the floor models had scratches...",4,1,1,1,1,1
Amazing help at Plattsburgh Lowes: Ross from the Plattsburgh Lowe‚Äôs was great. Helped loading the blackstone into my truck. Was raining so was helpful wrapping it up before loading it.,5,1,0,1,1,0
"Great Unit!: Overall, amazing!  Couple minor issues and only reason it‚Äôs not a (5) star: 1) when cleaning, the top is up, and you shove all the mess through the cleaning hole at the back, and when doing so, you end up dropping a bit of grease and mess into the back lip of the top (bad design), 2) super minor but the paper towel holder overlaps the LP tank hook, so you can‚Äôt really slide in, plus the hook is too far for a standard roll to actually turn, you have to cram it on, 3) although not super difficult ...",4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Terrible experience: Problems from after using it 2 X!  Lowes told me to call Blackstone Direct as they would be able to  help.  Well after replacing all the wrong parts and miscommunication  They replaced the lid which rusted and paint peeled and left the griddle with major rust issues.

"Cheap feeling: Don‚Äôt let Lowe‚Äôs fool you and sell you one that they ‚Äújust put on the floor‚Äù and had an associate build. That free assembly is not great. I purchased one from the floor that they had just build. Well when I got home and unloaded it, the front accessory for the spices fell and bent.

I thought I was ordering from local store but no it was a 2 hour delivery time to my home. They delivered and didn‚Äôt inspect before leaving.

"This is a review about Lowes, not Blackstone.: I haven't used my Blackstone yet, but I'm excited to learn how! 

My last two Lowes deliveries, however, have been dented. First it was my refrigerator with dents on the freezer and door (they also took my old refrigerator that I had planned to keep). Now the front tray and bottom shelf of my Blackstone were delivered dented (it was delivered assembled). These things aren't cheap so it's a bit of a let down when they show up damaged.

I bought this for Christmas 2022 for my wife and we've had to order replacement parts twice within 9 months because they are rusting away. I will not look at Blackstone when this thing turns into a pile of rust and I need to buy another griddle. Very disappointed. If I could give it zero stars I would.",1,1,0,-1,NA,NA

First, on page 7, the list of components fails to mention the four brackets used to mount the side shelves.

Impressed with the Blackstone so far !!: Wife and I went in to buy yet another gas grill - seems we buy one about every 5 years - we have bought cheap and weve bought expensive - they all rust and breakdown all with good intentions of keeping fully covered in the outdoor elements - but none the less - We were in Lowes buying our next grill when we ran into a guy that had bought a Blackstone a month earlier and just raved about it.

"Griddle: I have always used a traditional charcoal or gas grill but after using the griddle I may never go back.  It is so much more versatile than your standard grill.  I can cook my burgers and dogs on it but also sautee my onions and peppers and cook bacon as well.  Easy to use and clean, and evenly cooks food.  This model has a large cooking surface for lots of burgers and dogs and other foods (we did chicken on it the other day too).",5,1,-1,NA,NA,1

"Fantastic griddle.: My wife got me this for Father‚Äôs Day. I assembled it, which was pretty easy. It took about 2 hrs tops. It is much sturdier than the display unit at the store. I seasoned the grate about 4-5 times. Used canola oil first. Then vegetable oil. Then olive oil. Then canola again. It seasoned nicely. The front edge is still the least seasoned area but will eventually season dark like the rest. I‚Äôve cooked on it probably about 20 times so far. It‚Äôs fantastic.

Smash burger heaven: Wanted a flat top for a long time. This Blackstone more then meet (exceeds) my wants.  We went with a four burner so I can control cooking temperature. We thought about the 2 burner with air fryer but this one has way more btu‚Äôs and much easier to clean. Since out purchase I have cooked a variety of Meals. The neighbors always seem to stop by. The smells seem to invite them over. I highly recommend this Blackstone,5,1,1,1,-1,1

"Paint Peels and Rusts: I had seen other reviews where everyone was saying the paint starts to peel within 60 days and then the grill will rust. It is true. Blackstone says it is common because the paint didn't bake on properly.  They will send me a replacement lid and body, but they don't know how long it will be because they are having supply chain issues and everything is on back order.

Couldn't be happier: We bought this for the 4th of July party we held. Little over 40 people came this thing helped us out so much. We were able to cook up incredible amount of burgers and hot dogs at the same time.

Cooks Great but‚Ä¶: The griddle itself is great!  The stand it comes with is questionable.  The areas of the stand directly under the griddle have rusted in less than 4 months.

"Delicious Food with Easy Cleanup!: I absolutely love cooking on my new Blackstone griddle.  I've been able to make some delicious food and cleanup is simplified because it effectively eliminates the need for pots and pans.

Fantastic Grill: Absolutely love cooking on this grill surface! My only complaint is I wish it started easier. The burner furthest from the starter has a bit of trouble. Otherwise I find this grill to be very high quality. It cooks even and heats up fast. Very easy to clean.,4,1,-1,1,NA,NA

Thankful for a great product!",5,1,1,1,NA,1
"Propane regulator: Cooks great. Only issue is the regulator has a very sensitive flow limiter. If you turn the propane tank on more than just a smidge when lighting it shuts the regulator right down to a trickle. The trick is to barely open the valve, light 1 burner, open the propane valve half way, light the second burner, then you can turn on the propane tank all the way. That‚Äôs why I gave it only 4 stars.",4,NA,-1,NA,NA,NA

My chief complaint is the lid - it bends (like large sheets of metal tend to do) which is extremely unsafe if it‚Äôs up, because the movement causes it to fall sometimes (I‚Äôve gotten hit on the head already, not great.)",4,1,1,-1,0,1
Great griddle: Very user friendly and tons of knowledge on YouTube to help you get started. 5 coats of oil the first night to season it and it‚Äôs cooked perfect every time. It will take awhile to learn the zones and how it heats (it‚Äôs not only left to right it heats differently front to back) but it‚Äôs very rewarding and gives food a unique flavor,5,1,1,1,NA,1
